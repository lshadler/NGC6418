Version 2.51 - 2012-03-05 (ATI)
----------------------------------	
	+src changes for variable boresight
	
Version 2.50  - 2010-01-25 (CB)
----------------------------------
	+doc Amended documentation

Version 2.49.3  - 2009-06-12 (CB)

	for when no USNO catalogue available 
	(further fix to SPR 6542)
	
Version 2.49.2  - 2009-06-01 (CB)
----------------------------------
	+src Amended so that POSCOROK

Version 2.48  - 2009-03-13 (CB, VNY)
-----------------------------------	
	Removed the calls to pgplot (to avoid failures on MAC-computers) 
	and cleaned up in order to avoid the compillation warning messages  
Version 2.47  - 2009-03-13 (CB)
--------------------------------  	
        Removed "SSCLIB" from DEPEND file.
	Modified omrotation_mod.f90 to also rotate the
	16-bit QUALITY image.
	
Version 2.46.2 - 2008-06-16 (VNY)  +(src/omatt_mod.f90)
	A test-printing line was removed (continuation of the
	bug-fixing corresponding to SSC-SPR-6478)
Version 2.46.1 - 2008-06-16 (VNY)  +(src/omatt_mod.f90, omrotation_mod.f90)
	A bug is fixed which was causing the setting of the POSCOROK
	keyword in the header of the rotated image to TRUE when 
	the number of matching sources was too small and the actual
	value of this parameter must be FALSE (SSC-SPR-6478).
Version 2.46 - 2008-04-21 (VNY) +(src/omatt_mod.f90, omrotation_mod.f90)
	The value of the attribute RA_OFF is divided by cos(dec) 
	- without this the mosaiced images would show a small 
	shifts for high declinations.
Version 2.45 - 2008-04-07 (VNY) 
	+(src/omatt_mod.f90, omrotation_mod.f90)
	Added two new attributes to the rotated (sky) image 
        FITs file: RA_OFF and DEC_OFF (in arcseconds) to indicate 
        the amount of astrometric correction applied to the image
	(further improvement related to SSC-SPR-3707)
Version 2.44 - 2008-02-15 (VNY)
	+(src/omatt_mod.f90, omrotation_mod.f90)
	Correcting the values of the attriburtes CRVAL1 and CRVAL2
	of the sky (rotated) image in the case of the parameter
	usecat=yes, which means that the calculated astrometry 
	corrections of RA and DEC are applied not only to the source
	coordinates in the source list, but also to the sky-image
	(for its further correct mosaicing by the ommosaic task).
	SSC-SPR-3707
-------------------------------	
Version 2.43 - 2007-03-09 (VNY)
-------------------------------
	Additional data for grism source positions is itroduced 
	for calculation of the right ascensions and 
	declinations for zero-order features for different combinations
	of primary instruments, high/low resolution modes and 
	grism filters (UV- or V-grism). Fixing SSC-SPR-3652.
Version 2.42 - 2006-11-09 (VNY)
------------------------------
	modified to make the grism sources coordinates computation
	more accurate (SSC-SPR-3633)
Version 2.41 - 2006-05-30 (VNY)
------------------------------
	introduced the calculation of RA and DECs for Grisms 
	(the modifications will be noticeable only when processing 
	the observations with the grism filter since corresponding
	flags are introduced in order to distinguish in between the 
	other filters - old code - and the grism filters - the modified 
	code). The changes correspond to SSC-SPR-3605.
Version 2.40  - 2005-09-02 (CB)
------------------  	
        Made a minor modification to subroutine modifypositionangles
	to prevent source position angles exceeding 180 degrees when
	transformed to celestial equator coordinate system.

------------------

	acceptance of astrometry fit (SPR 3329).
Version 2.39.3  - 2004-03-16 (CB)
------------------  
	Small ammendmment made to omrotation_mod to fix bright pixels 
	appearing edges of rotated image (fixes SPR 3276)

       Removed spurious appmessage call in omatt_mod.f90
	
Version 2.32  - 2003-03-15 (CB) 
--------------  
       Modified to use the module omastron_mod in msslib to do the

--------------
        +(src/) Added the code to do the astrometry correction. Removed
	code that reset parameter usecat to FALSE if it had been set to
	TRUE. Parameter usecat default value changed to FALSE.
	If usecat set to T then omatt will attempt to do an astrometric
	fit and if successful will add corrected RA and DEC columns to the

	discrepancy between source on rotated image and the overlaid

--------------
        +(src/) Checks added to ensure that indices of array oswimage stay
	within the bounds (distortion correction problem-(fixes SPR 2248)


Version 2.21.1 - 2001-02-07
--------------
        +(src/) Old versions of program deleted.

	coordinates of rotated image. Extra image added to PPSOW
	file to store the exposure map.


Version 2.20.6   - 2000-11-15 (CB)
--------------
	+(src/omatt_mod.f90) Some write statements removed.


Version 2.20.3   - 2000-11-07 (CB)
--------------
	+(config/omatt.info) om added.


Version 2.20.2   - 2000-10-13 (CB)
--------------
	+(src/omatt_description.f90) Fixed syntax error in the documentation.


Version 2.20.1   - 2000-10-12 (AMK)
--------------
	+(src/omatt_description.f90) Fixed syntax error in the documentation.

Version 2.20   - 2000-10-11 (AMK)
--------------
	+(src/omatt_description.f90) Removed test write statments.

Version 2.19   - 2000-10-11 (AMK)
--------------
	+(doc/omatt_description.tex) SSC-SPR-1980. Corrected fatal message in the documentation.

Version 2.18   - 2000-10-10 (CB)
--------------
	+(src/omatt_mod.f90) Changed program so that if parameter "usecat"
	is TRUE then a warning message is displayed saying that the
	catalogue is not yet available. usecat is then set to false.

Version 2.17   - 2000-10-05 (AMK)
--------------
	+(src/omatt_mod.f90) Removed mssllib call getFilterId and replaced
	it by OAL call filterIdToInt.

Version 2.16   - 2000-09-29 (AMK)
--------------
	+(src/Makefile) Changed order of libraries


===================
Version 2.15   - 2000-09-26 (AMK)
--------------
	+(src/Makefile) Changed order of libraries
	.
Version 2.14   - 2000-09-07 (AMK)
--------------
	+(ChangeLog) Added -90 degree image rotation to correct for error in coordinate system.
	Maths functions sin and cos replaced by dsin and dcos (double precision versions),
	& some other changes to double precision made.
	Output image corrected for image distortion.
	Function "MissionTime" added to compute the difference between the
	average of the start and end observations and the mission reference time, in seconds.
	Function "FilterWavelength" added to give the filter wavelenth
	(nanometers) for a given filter (presently U, B, V & R). There appears to be no CAL
	routine for doing this. This is needed to get the correct
	plate-scale.Unfortunately, the CAL call getplatescale returns 0.5
	whatever the input wavelength- the value is therefore currently
	fixed at 0.4765
	Some code added to write standard coordinates to an output file for test purposes (temporary)
	Some write statements deleted. The +ve signs for the distortion corrections changed to -ve.
	Attitude matrix read in. Boresight calculation changed - uses [A*(B)^-1]*(1,0,0).
