ChangeLog for ommag
------------------- 	
Version 3.11.1 - 2014-10-27 (RDS): 
	Documentation fix - SCR-7248
Version 3.11 - 2014-03-19 (VNY): 
	Dependency updated to mssllib-2.75;  the calculation of the binobial 
	error bars is switched on (it was switched off in the previous version);
	modified the calculation of binomial
	errors by using the observed count rates in the formula (7)
	instead of incident coints (which was giving a smaller error
	then expected); setting to null the corrected rate errors
 	for thge sources with raw count rates >0.97; 
	fixed a bug in calculating the source count rate error
	in the case when the initial source count rate error exceeds the source rate;
	now in this case the source rate error is calculated by using the background rate,
	i.e. using the formula sqrt(s+2b).
Version 3.10.6 - 2013-11-26 (VNY)
-------------	
	+src/ommag_mod.f90, ccountrateerror_mod.f90: 
	modified the column CORR_BKG_RATE_ERR by applying to it 
	the time-dependent correction factor; 
	fine-tuned the interpolation of binomial error bars.
Version 3.10.5 - 2013-11-26 (VNY)
-------------	
	+src/ommag_mod.f90, countrateerror_mod.f90: 
	changing the order of applying the time-dependent
	correction factor and the coincidence-loss correction
	factor to the count-rate errors: the time-dependent
	factor is applied at the end because that is how it 
	was calibrated (fixing the problem reported in 
	SSC-SPR-0007165). Also removing the sqrt(s+2b) 
	addition to the coincidence-loss corrected error
	bars as this addition was already made in omdetect.
	
Version 3.10.4 - 2013-11-10 (VNY)
--------------
	+src/ommag_mod.f90, countrateerror_mod.f90: 
	simplified the algorithm for calculating
	the rigourous (binomial) count-rate error using the formula (7)
	from Kuin&Rosen paper MNRAS 383, 383 (2008). The module brent2_mod.f90
	is removed as obsolete for the simlified code.
Version 3.10.3 - 2013-11-10 (VNY)
--------------
	+src/ommag_mod.f90, brent2_mod.f90, countrateerror_mod.f90:
	fixed a bug in the subroutine "brent" which was leading
        to wrong calcilation of the coincidence-loss correction 
	error-bars. This change fixes the problem reported in 
	SSC-SPR-7152.
Version 3.10.2 -  2009-07-21 (CB)
-------------
        +test Removed ssclib from Makefile to fix
	gcc4 build failure

-------------------------------
	Ammended routine ommagnitude_mod in mssllib to set default 
	polynomial coefficents to 1.0 and 0.0 (fixes SPR 3483 - mssllib
	version 2.43.12 has this fix)	
	Also replaced source-list file in test directory with a more
	recent one to fix problem of negative magnitudes which cause
	a test-failure on one system.
	Also introduced Simon Rosen's algorithm for calculating more
	accurate source-rate error bars for high count-rates (an SPR
	3337 was raised for this some time ago, but unfortunately it was't
	included in ommag).

_____________________________	

Version 2.2.2 2002-02-15  (CB) DEPEND file ammended to fix SPR 2757. 
_____________________________	

Version 2.2.1 2002-01-27  (CB) 
_____________________________	
	 Modified configuration file. Changed call to Cal_omPhotNatural so
	 that empiricallinearitycorrection flag is set to true and
	 extendsource flag always set to false. (fixes SPR 2720).

Version 2.2 2002-01-08  (CB) - Modified DEPEND file for ssclib

Version 2.1 2001-12-13  (CB) - Modified to pass BINBPE parameter to 
	GetFrameTime- which has been modified for SPR 2571.

Version 2.0.1 2001-08-13  (CB) - Added check to stop the counts-frame
ratio exceeding 1 - to fix SPR ? 

Version 2.0 2001-07-16  (CB) - Program now reads in additional columns
(source photometry aperture radii and source coordinates) from the
source-list file produced by omdetect , and, if necessary (ie if the aperture radius is less
than 12 pixels), extrapolates the source counts the to the
12-pixel radius used by the CAL calibration. For the UV filters, a further
extrapolation is done to a radius of 35 pixels. A bug in computing the
magnitude errors fixed (SPRs 2460 and 2430- raised for omsrclistcomb).  
Coincidence-loss corrections done correcty using the background counts.
