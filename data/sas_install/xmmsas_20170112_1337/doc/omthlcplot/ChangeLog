ChangeLog for omthlcplot
===============================

Version 1.4 - 2016-06-30 (AI)
-----------------------------
	+ (src/omthlcplot_mod.f90) gfortran compatibility changes. 
	"label" variable name is not allowed in gfortran.
	
Version 1.3 - 2002-09-12 (NW)
-------------------------------
 
        Changed the keyword warning statement in the documentation to
 	include the values of the HDUCLASS attributes, to close SPR-2973
 	(Wrong reference to data set attributes in doc).  Also changed the
 	figure in the documentation to .eps (was .ps) to avoid warnings
 	during the distribution check.

Version 1.1 - 15-06-03 (NW)
----------------------

        Made the updates necessary for the new version of param
	

Version 1.0.4 - 15-03-02 (NW)
----------------------

        The documentation has been updated to include new error names.

Version 1.0.3 - 22-05-01
----------------------

        The documentation has been updated to include examples of how to
        use omthlcplot.

Version 1.0.2 - 27-04-01
-----------------------  

        The dimensions of the array Label were not consistent throughout
        the task.  This has been rectified.  The test harness has been
        changed to be variable for Linux or Unix, because the environment
        variables are different.  In this way, the test can be passed on
        Linux or Unix.


Version 1.0.1 - 08-02-01
-----------------------  
        The environment variables for `pgplot' were different to those 
        at the `static build' and hence the test was not passed, as the 
        output files were different to the comparison files.  The 
        environment variables for `pgplot' are now changed, so the 
        output files of the `static build' should pass the test.


Version 1.0 - 19/01/01
----------------------------

        - Task approved and uploaded
	
Version 0.1 - 09/01/01
----------------------------

	- Task produced ready for approval
