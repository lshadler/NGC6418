ChangeLog for efftplot
===============================

Version 2.20 - 2016-08-26 (EO)
------------
	+ src/Makefile: Added code to proccess Fortran preprocessor
	directives.
	+ DEPEND: Updated to sas-1.573 that implements new policy for
	preprocessor compilations.

Version 2.19.1 - 2016-08-25 (EO)
--------------
	+ src/Makefile: Removed ifeq to set F90FLAGS depending on Fortran
	  compiler. This was left unchanged in 2.19.
	+ DEPEND: sas 1.572 is required to build properly this version.

Version 2.19 - 2016-08-24 (EO)
------------
	+ src/efftplot_mod.f90: Added preprocessor directive ifdef
	 NAGf90Fortran before use f90_unix_proc to allow to load this NAG
	 Frotran supplied module only when NAG Fortran compiler is used.
	 This change is effective only after SAS configure includes
	 preprocessor capabilities (after sas-1.571). Otherwise a similar
	 functionality must be available in src/Makefile. 
	 For NAG Fortran compiler, the inclussion of preprocessor switch -fpp
	 unveiled a syntax error in original line 324, a blank line after 
	 "window         ",&
	 which has been removed. 

Version 2.18.2 - 2012-19-04 (NW)
------------

	The coordinates given in the header of the output of efftplot 
	are now displayed to .00 for RA and .0 for Dec. even when the 
	(arc)seconds are inferior to 10, as requested in SPR 6714.



Version 2.18.1 - 2012-04-04 (NW)
------------
	the coordinates given in the header of the output of efftplot 
	are now fixed to .00 for RA and .0 for Dec., as requested in SPR 6496.




Version 2.18 - 2010-01-18 (EO)
------------
	+ efftplot_mod.f90: Added use_f90_unix_proc to include support for subroutine
	  system (used to execute shell commands).
	  The support is made through NAG supported modules as provided in their library
	  directory. 
	  In order to fulfill the software dependencies, the keyword NAGSUPMODS = yes
	  must be present in src/Makefile.

Version 2.17 - 2006-12-12 (NAW)
----------------------------------

	Previously efftplot searched for a file produced by powspec that 
	contained the good points to be used in the FFT.  If no file existed 
	efftplot stated that there were not enough good points and no plot 
	was produced.  However, there is the case where the file can be 
	produced, but no plot results.  This is for the case of <4 good 
	points.  A new loop has been added to check for this situation and 
	no plot results in this case.  This closes SSC-SPR-3638.


Version 2.16.4 - 2006-03-07 (NAW)
----------------------------------

        If there were no GTIs in the GTI file, the task went ahead and 
        produced the output file regardless.  Now the task gives a warning 
        and no power spectrum plot is produced.  The documentation has 
        been updated.
    

Version 2.16.3 - 2005-11-29 (IMS/LUX)
        -------------------------------
Last mod introduced a seg fault; now fixed.


Version 2.16.2 - 2005-11-24 (NW)
        -------------------------------

  	Changed the error NotEnoughBins to a warning and kept the status 
	that no output file is produced in this case, as requested so that 
	there are fewer errors in the pipeline logfile.  The documentation 
	has also been updated. 

	
Version 2.16.1 - 2005-06-07 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
	Changes made to DEPEND for the releasetrack version

	
Version 2.16 - 2005-03-03 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        New error (NotEnoughBins) introduced that ensures that no plot is
	produced if there are too few bins to create the power density
	spectrum.  Documentation has been updated.
	

Version 2.15 - 2005-01-28 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Efftplot now reads and plots the corrected source RA and DEC.
	

Version 2.14 - 2004-12-15 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Efftplot now reads the new FITS keywords SRCNUM, SRC_RA, SRC_DEC
	written into the lccorr output and writes these values on the plots
	produced.


Version 2.13 - 2004-11-01 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        New development track version.  Changes made to the presentation
	of the header and title of the power spectrum.  The linear plot is
	now shown with the same size gap between the left and right frame.
	The default is that net counts are used for the fourier transform.

	
	
Version 2.10.4 - 2004-08-27 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Explicitly reads the total rates and background counts before
	passing the file to powspec, so that the total rates and
	background rates can be checked for negative values.  The user may
	now choose whether the total or net counts are used to produce the
	power density spectrum, via an optional parameter `bkgsub'.  The
	documentation has been updated.
	

Version 2.10.3 - 2004-08-10 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Changed error calculation for the total counts, when they are
	recovered from the net and background counts.
	

Version 2.10.2 - 2004-08-09 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        This version now shows a line plot, rather than points.
	

Version 2.10.1 - 2004-08-01 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        This version now accepts a user provided GTI file.  It also takes
	a background subtracted lightcurve and corrects the lightcurve to
	have total counts (counts + background).  The error bars are no
	longer plotted and there is now a space between the y-axis and the
	first point, when xscale=lin is chosen.  Also modifications that
	were being made to the FITS header of the input file are no longer
	being made (SSC-SPR-3362). The documentation has duly been updated.

Version 2.10 - 2004-07-01 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Revised some of the warning statements that were unnecessary

Version 2.9 - 2004-05-14 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Small changes to avoid efftplot crashing with lccorr files.

Version 2.8 - 2002-07-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Updated the DEPEND file. It now includes a dependence on sas.
                                    
                                            
Version 2.7 - 2002-06-03 (NW)
----------------------

        Made the updates necessary for the new version of param
	
Version 2.6.1 - 22-05-01
----------------------

        The documentation has been updated to include examples of how to
	use efftplot.

Version 2.6 - 06-04-01
----------------------

        The test harness has been changed to be variable for Linux or
        Unix, because the environment variables are different.  In this
        way, the test can be passed on Linux or Unix.

Version 2.5.1 - 08-02-01
-----------------------  
        The environment variables for `pgplot' were different to those 
        at the `static build' and hence the test was not passed, as the 
        output files were different to the comparison files.  The 
        environment variables for `pgplot' are now changed, so the 
        output files of the `static build' should pass the test.


Version 2.5 - 19-12-00
	---------------------- 
	Changed the test file, so that it doesn't call gs.  Also changed
 	the header information of the files that are written out by ftools
 	in efftplot, so that the headers are compatible with the SAS
 	software.

Version 2.4 - 31-10-00
----------------------
	Updated GROUPS description and the documentation

Version 2.3 - 03-10-00
----------------------
	Fix the parameter and info files 
	Updrade the version number as required for the SAS V5

Version 2.2.1 - 27-06-00
------------------------
	SSC-SPR-1818 efftplot (version 2.2): update documentation to remove non-existant link to powspec
	
Version 2.2 - 22-05-00
----------------------
	- Add efftplot.info file in the config directory
	
Version 2.1 - 18-04-00
----------------------

	The following SPRs have been taken into account:

	- SSC-SPR-1641 efftplot (version 2.0): documentation macros
	
Version 2.0 - 07-03-00
----------------------

	The following SPRs have been taken into account:
	
 	SSC-SPR-1565 efftplot (version 1.3): When setting the parameter
 	gapfill to 1, we get the error message "value 1 is not an allowed
 	value
        
   	SSC-SPR-1564 efftplot (version 1.3): The values in the last
 	incomplete data segment have an effect on the output
        
   	SSC-SPR-1563 efftplot (version 1.3): efftplot always overwrites an
 	existing output file
        
   	SSC-SPR-1562 efftplot (version 1.3): There is no parameter layout
 	file
        
   	SSC-SPR-1561 efftplot (version 1.3): File config.par is to be
 	updated
        
   	SSC-SPR-1560 efftplot (version 1.3): Description paragraph should
 	give the definition of "normalized PDS"
        
   	SSC-SPR-1559 efftplot (version 1.3): Algorithm description should
 	indicate which options are used to call powspec.

Version 1.3 - 26-11-99
----------------------
