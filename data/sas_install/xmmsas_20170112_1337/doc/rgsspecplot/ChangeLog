ChangeLog for rgsspecplot
===============================


Version 2.21 - 2011-07-05 (NW)
	-------------------------------

	Ensured that the correction made in version 2.20 is also applied 
	to the second order spectrum and modified the precision on 
	the right ascension and declination that is displayed on the 
	plot, as previously the number of decimal places given resulted 
	in a truncation of the text to be displayed.

	
Version 2.20 - 2011-05-26 (NW)
	-------------------------------

	Added 6 lines to the source code to ensure that if there are 
	insufficient counts in the spectrum and therefore no rebinning 
	occurs although requested by the user, the x-axis scale is 
	still correctly display

	
Version 2.19.1 - 2010-03-03 (EO on behalf of NW)
	-------------------------------

	-src/Makefile: In USEDLIBS removed mssplot and mssl libraries. 
	 They produced a lot of errors of the form "duplicated symbol" 
	 when used together with ssc library on Mac OS X buildings.
	-doc/rgsspecplot_description.tex: Removed extra "}" around line 128,
         which was breaking the processing of the documentation.
	-Cleaned of temporary build.tmp_ files.
	-Removed unnecessary bin/devel and lib/... empty subdirectories. 


Version 2.19 - 2010-02-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Modified the code to accept spectra given in wavelength space.
	The counts/channel is plotted against wavelength (Angstroms) in
	this case (SCR 287).
	

Version 2.18.4 - 2006-09-06 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
	Moved the part of the code that determines the first spectrum channel 
	to before the place where binning can be carried out if the user 
	requires it, as it was taking the minimum channel as the first channel 
        in the binned spectrum when rebinning was required, so the wavelength 
        scale was wrong (SSC-SPR-3628)

        


Version 2.18.3 - 2005-11-28 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
        Added a third type of  spectrumtype to the labels (SRC+BKG) at 
	the request of IMS and have also added a further label to the 
	plot with information about the source.


Version 2.18.2 - 2005-11-21 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
        Changed the limit of the number of sources allowed to 999 (from 100) 
	in the rgsspecplot.par file as the new pipeline was falling over 
	with such a low limit.


Version 2.18.1 - 2002-07-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
        Only uses poissonian errors if there is no STAT_ERR column


Version 2.18 - 2002-07-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
        Update the DEPEND file and now includes a dependence on sas.


Version 2.17.2 - 2002-07-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------
  
        Removed the dependency on the STAT_ERR column, now use the square
 	root of the counts as the error, to close the SPR 2949, `Task
 	unable to plot total spectrum'.  Revised documentation.


Version 2.17.1 - 2002-07-01 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        The way that the binned up data is presented has been changed.
  	The errors are now the square root of the binned up counts, which
 	solves the problem of `plots from empty fields are negative on
 	average', SSC-SPR-2898.  This also solves the problem SSC-SPR-2903
 	`Wrong wavelength and energy scales'.  The x-axis has also been
 	extended to show the whole of the first and last bin


Version 2.17 - 2002-06-03 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        This version contains the changes for the new version of
        param.
        
                              
Version 2.16.11 - 2002-06-03 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        This version does not contain the changes for the new version of
        param, only the new documentation.                                      

Version 2.16.10 - 2002-06-03 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Made the necessary changes for the new version of param and
 	updated the documentation to describe how the binning is done.

	
Version 2.16.9 - 2002-05-16 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Extended the y-scale for the case of a spectral plot which has
 	maximum counts less than the maximum error, so that the error
 	values (which are always positive) can be viewed.  
	
Version 2.16.8 - 2002-05-09 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        The data is now plotted as a histogram, as requested in SPR 2860
 	(histogram-style please).  Documentation has been updated.

	
Version 2.16.7 - 2002-04-25 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Extended the y-scale for the case of a spectral plot which has
 	only negative values, so that the error values (which are always
 	positive) can be viewed.

	
	
Version 2.16.6 - 2002-03-15 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

	 Added the missing error label names as requested for Version 5.3
	 in the documentation.

	
Version 2.16.5 - 2002-03-06 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Changed the way in which the errors are presented, by plotting a
	grey histogram of the errors on each plot.  The obs id and the exp
	idstr have replaced the exp id and if the data were rebinned, the
	binning factor, for each plot, is displayed.  However, the header
	information is only displayed once on the plot.  The x-axis of
	both plots is now always the same as the first plot.  The energy
	scale has also been extended.
	


Version 2.16.4 - 2002-02-26 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Added if-clause with warning to stop the program entering an
	infinite loop if the minimum counts per bin are negative, as
	noticed in SSC-SPR-2767, infinite loop.


Version 2.16.3 - 2002-02-20 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Added two if-clauses with warnings (warnings documented in
	documentation) to stop the program terminating with a fatal error,
	when there are very few counts in the spectrum and the minimum
	counts per bin requested is larger than than the number of counts
	in the spectrum, as noticed in SSC-SPR-2767, subscript out of
	range in rgsspecplot.


Version 2.16.2 - 2002-02-11 (NW)
        ------------------------------- 

        Changed the mode `a' to `h' in the rgsspecplot.par, as rgsspecplot
        failed distribution check on linux build.


Version 2.16.1 - 2002-02-7 (NW)
	------------------------------- 

	Rgsspecplot now plots the weighted mean, when the user requests
	that the counts are rebinned to a minimum value per bin.


Version 2.16 - 2002-01-17 (NW)
	------------------------------- 

	Rgsspecplot now plots the negative values. The object, exposure
	time, ra and dec of the object, aswell as version number of
	rgsspecplot have all been added to the output plot.  
	

	
Version 2.15 - 2002-01-14 (NW)
	------------------------------- 

	Rgsspecplot now reads both COUNTS or RATE and also rebins the
	spectra, if requested, to a minimum value, specified by the user.
