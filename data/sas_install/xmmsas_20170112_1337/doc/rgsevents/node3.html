adds the <A NAME="497"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> and <A NAME="499"></A><TT>REJPIXn</TT> tables
 to the intermediate event list for a single RGS CCD exposure, which
 has been processed by <A NAME="501"></A><A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="../rgsbadpix/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsbadpix</SPAN></A>.  These tables are sorted in

increasing order of frame number.  The <A NAME="505"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table is also
 cross-referenced with the existing <A NAME="507"></A><TT>PIXELS</TT> table so that the
 correspondence between the reconstructed events and the raw
 telemetered pixels is not lost.  Throughout this document a <IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="\dag">  marks items that do not apply to High Time Resolution (HTR) mode data
 and a <IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="\ddag"> marks items that apply only to HTR mode data.

<P>
The event reconstruction algorithm defines an event as a maximal set
 of adjacent pixels.  That is, any two pixels which share an edge are
 contained within the same event.  The user has the option to disable
 event reconstruction, which only means that each qualifying
 telemetered pixel is treated as a separate event regardless of its
 proximity to other pixels.  To cross-reference the reconstructed
 events with their comprising telemetered pixels a column named
 <A NAME="509"></A><TT>EVENT</TT> is added to the <A NAME="511"></A><TT>PIXELS</TT> table, in which is
 recorded for each pixel the <A NAME="513"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table row number of the
 event in which it is included, or null if it is not associated with
 an event.  From the raw pixel data the following properties are
 computed for each event and stored in the <A NAME="515"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table.  Also
 stored for each event are three properties copied from the
 <A NAME="517"></A><TT>EXPOSURE</TT> table: frame number, flags and timestamp.

Total energy, both calibrated and raw.

Total number of pixels, or area of the event.

Chip-oriented DPP shape code for any event confined within a

 <A NAME="519"></A><TT>PIXELS</TT> table the telemetered coordinates mark the location of
 the reference pixel, but in the <A NAME="521"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table the centroid
 coordinates may lie anywhere within the bounding rectangle of the
 event.

The pixel under the event centroid shares an edge with a pixel from
  the bad pixel tables.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="527"></A><TT>ON_WINDOW_BORDER</TT>

The pixel under the event centroid lies in the first or last row or
  column of the telemetered window.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="529"></A><TT>ON_NODE_INTERFACE</TT>

<P>
The pixel under the event centroid shares an edge with the opposing
  node.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="531"></A><TT>BELOW_ACCEPTANCE</TT>

<P>
The calibrated energy of every pixel included in the event lies
  below the acceptance threshold.

<LI><A NAME="533"></A><TT>BAD_SHAPE</TT>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="535"></A><TT>ON_NODE0</TT>

At least one pixel included in the event lies in node zero.

<P>
</LI>

At least one pixel included in the event lies in node one.

<P>
At least one pixel included in the event represents an on-board
  reconstruction.

  HREF="../rgsframes/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsframes</SPAN></A>
in the
 <A NAME="546"></A><TT>EXPOSURE</TT> table.  For each flag present in the output table a
 Sparse message declares the total number of events so flagged.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For each node the CCF provides PI thresholds for acceptance and
 rejection--not to be confused with similarly named thresholds used
 on-board by the Data Preprocessor (DPP).  Since these thresholds are
 directly applicable only to single-pixel energies, the average
 highest single-pixel energy is computed for pixels with on-board
 split-event reconstruction (SER) using an empirical charge-splitting
 ratio provided for each grade (no SER correction is applied in HTR
 mode).  Any pixel with PI less than the rejection threshold is
 ignored, just as if it had not been telemetered.  Further, any event
 that does not include at least one pixel with PI at or above the
 acceptance threshold is flagged with <A NAME="548"></A><TT>BELOW_ACCEPTANCE</TT>.  The
 floating-point pixel PI values are summed over the pixels comprising
 each event and ``pixelized'' by rounding to the nearest integer.  The
 pixelization of the event PI values, as well as the minimum and
 maximum (pixelized) values present in the data, are described by
 standard FITS attributes on the <A NAME="550"></A><TT>PI</TT> column of the
 <A NAME="552"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table.  It may be unwise to assume that the minimum
 value is nonnegative.

<P>
A null shape code implies nothing about the shape of the event.  In
 particular, it does not imply that the event is not confined within a
 two-by-two pixel region.  A previous version of the DPP does not
 provide enough information about pixels of grade two and three for
 the ground software to determine the shape.  Use the
 <A NAME="554"></A><TT>BAD_SHAPE</TT> event flag to test whether an event is two-by-two
 confined.  The event centroid is computed as a PI weighted sum over
 randomized sub-pixel coordinates (to avoid aliasing effects).  For
 pixels with on-board SER the combined energy is treated as if spread
 uniformly over the telemetered shape.  If the shape is not available
 for a pixel, its energy is placed at a random offset from its upper
 right corner.  HTR mode y-coordinates are randomly distributed over
 the full 384 row height of the chip (disabling randomization produces
 the nominal readout row used in the energy corrections).
 Randomization may be disabled via the CAL state.  This program does
 not attempt to identify cosmic-rays by pulse-height analysis.  If an
 event falls within a two-by-two pixel region it is considered to be
 an x-ray; otherwise it is something with a bad shape--possibly a
 cosmic-ray.  Note that if any of the pixels in a two-by-two region
 have no shape information, <A NAME="556"></A><TT>BAD_SHAPE</TT> is not set as long as
 all pixels are under grade three.  This should not be an issue with
 the current DPP, and in any case should pertain only to events
 straddling the node boundary.

<P>
While determining the flags for each event, special note is taken of
 pixels with certain flags, when these flags have not been set
 identically in the bad pixel map.  These are additional rejectable
 pixels and may be needed when constructing the exposure map.  The
 flags in question are: <A NAME="558"></A><TT>BAD_SHAPE</TT>, <A NAME="560"></A><TT>ON_BADPIX</TT>,
 <A NAME="562"></A><TT>NEXT_TO_BADPIX</TT>, <A NAME="564"></A><TT>ON_WINDOW_BORDER</TT> and
 <A NAME="566"></A><TT>ON_NODE_INTERFACE</TT>.  The chip coordinates of each such pixel
 are added to the <A NAME="568"></A><TT>REJPIXn</TT> table for its node, along with its
 frame number and any of these flags that were set on its associated
 event.  The <A NAME="570"></A><TT>REJPIXn</TT> tables augment the <A NAME="572"></A><TT>BADPIXn</TT> tables
 for the purpose of mapping exposure.
