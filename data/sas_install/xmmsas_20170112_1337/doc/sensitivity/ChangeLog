ChangeLog for esensitivity
===============================

Open SPRs:
----------
3215

Version 1.10 - 2016-09-08 (AI)
----------------------
- (src/econvolverprep_mod.f90) Initialization to null of all 
pointers that are passed to C++ (Dope vectors). If we do 
not initizialize the pointers, we get seg fault at run-time with gcc-6.2.

Version 1.9 - 2009-02-02 (IMS/JBO)
----------------------
- Originally developed by IMS/JBO on 2006-10-19.
- Upgraded ssclib dependency to 4.0.
- All logical(bool) types changed to logical.
- Fixed bug in which numBands was being obtained from some public declaration in a used module.

Version 1.8 - 2005-11-17 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Parameter --withboresightfudge (default 'yes') added to econvolverprep (until sign of boresight psi is corrected).

Version 1.7 - 2005-11-07 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Changed calls to asmooth in src/esensitivity.pl in order to keep up with changes in asmooth parameters. DEPEND on asmooth thus also upgraded to 2.25.
- Slightly changed test harness.

Version 1.6 - 2004-11-09 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Fixed SPR 3421 by adding dsslib to the DEPEND file (also saslib & oal!)

Version 1.5 - 2004-08-04 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Test harness now fails if test data not found.

Version 1.4 - 2004-06-16 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Call to ssclib/polygon/regrid had changed place and name, which broke esensitivity. Now fixed.

Version 1.3 - 2004-04-19 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Updated ssclib interfaces to 3.9 standard.

Version 1.2 - 2004-04-05 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Now uses test data in package testprods.

Version 1.1 - 2004-03-25 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Copy of patches to devtrack.

Version 1.0.6 - 2004-03-17 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- Bug-fixing version.

Version 1.0.5 - 2004-03-12 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- Wrote the documentation;
- added some text to the error calls in econvolverprep and sensitivity;
- in esensitivity, changed error message calls from 'private' subroutine to SAS::error.

Version 1.0.4 - 2004-03-03 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- Some slight fixes to allow it to compile and run against ssclib-3.6.8.
- Distribution changed to ssc until I have time to address the doco and spr 3215.

Version 1.0.3 - 2003-12-22 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- Temporarily disabled test harness to prevent it taking ages (as reported by Saclay and MPE).

Version 1.0.2 - 2003-12-22 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- Added asmooth to DEPEND.

Version 1.0.1 - 2003-12-19 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- Adjusted the code to cope with changes to ssclib-3.6.2/coordinate.f90:getPsfImagePixelCorners.

Version 1.0 - 2003-12-11 (IMS SSC/LUX)
--------------------------
- First version delivered to SOC.
