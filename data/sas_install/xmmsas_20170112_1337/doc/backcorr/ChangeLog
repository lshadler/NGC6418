ChangeLog for backcorr
===============================

Version 3.6 - 2006-01-09 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Corrected a small calculation error in make_backcorr that was 
	causing some values in the output (corrected background spectrum) to 
	be too small by a factor 0.5 or 0.333 as pointed out in SSC-SPR-3551.  
	The same SPR requested that the detector map used to calculate the 
	arf file for the background 
	spectrum should be a flat detector map and further parameters to be 
	added to the task so that the user can provide the eventlist, 
	required by arfgen if a bad pixel correction is to be made as well as 
	the option to keep the intermediary arf files.  RDS also suggested 
	calling arfgen with extendedsource=yes.  These have all been 
	done and the documentation has been updated.
	

Version 3.5.1 - 2005-06-07 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Change to DEPEND for releasetrack version
	

Version 3.5 - 2004-11-26 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Included dsslib' in DEPEND, as requested in SSC-SPR-3420.

	
Version 3.4 - 2004-11-02 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Fixed a small bug that could result in a divide by zero in some cases.

	

Version 3.3 - 2003-11-03 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Changed the USEDLIBS in the src/Makefile so that the task also 
	builds in the static build

	
Version 3.2 - 2003-05-07 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        Changed the test harness, as the detector map may not be specified
	in X/Y coordinates in the current release of arfgen.  This closes
	SPR-3118, `test harness fails whilst running arfgen'.
	

Version 3.1 - 2002-11-20 (NW)
        -------------------------------

        As version 3.0, but with param 2. + for the development track.
	
	
Version 3.0 - 2002-11-19 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Major revisions after questions from the helpdesk.  Corrected the
 	cycle theiloop to cycle thejloop (typo) and added parameters to
 	allow the user to make a background correction for highly off-axis
 	sources if required.  Added inputs for the source co-ordinates, to
 	be used by arfgen, in the same manner as arfgen.  A PSF function
 	is now used for the `detmaptype' and the BACKSCAL value is
 	set. The documention and the test harness have also been updated.
                                      
                                            
Version 2.4 - 2002-07-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Updated the DEPEND file. It now includes a dependence on sas.
                                    
                                            
Version 2.3 - 2002-06-03 (NW)
----------------------

        Made the updates necessary for the new version of param

Version 2.2.4 - 08-02-02 (NW)
----------------------

	Test harness completely changed to solve the problem raised in
	SPR-2732 `test_backcorr. 2 fixes so test passes at MPE'. The test
	now calls a fortran program to test the output of backcorr, by
	checking the spectral content and the content of the headers.  In
	this way any problems with different platforms is avoided.

	
Version 2.2.3 - 23-11-01
----------------------

	Changes made to the test, to reflect the recent changes made to
	programs preceding backcorr.

	
Version 2.2.2 - 07-11-01
----------------------

       Further refinements made to the test, to stop it failing on Linux.

Version 2.2.1 - 19-10-01
----------------------

       A change has been made to the test, to stop it failing on Linux.
	
Version 2.2 - 12-09-01
----------------------

        A `do loop' at the end of the `make_backcorr' module has been changed
	so that the energy boundaries don't have to exactly match those of
	the arf.  This is to stop `backcorr' crashing with 'Internal file
	overflow', with regards to SPR 2511. The test has also been
	changed, so that it doesn't rely on the type of ftools being run,
	thus solving the problem in SPR 2532.
	

Version 2.1.5 - 31-05-01
----------------------

	The test has also been changed so that it doesn't test for
	high or a low memory model.

Version 2.1.4 - 30-05-01
----------------------

	The test has also been changed so that it takes into account a
	high or a low memory model.

Version 2.1.3 - 22-05-01
----------------------

        Documentation has been changed to include an example of how to use
	backcorr and to document the columns required in the input files.
	The test has also been changed to make it sensitive to error in
	the task.

Version 2.1.2 - 27-04-01
----------------------

        Changed the system call to call deleteDataSet which is appropriate
	for the SAS.

Version 2.1.1 - 02-11-00
----------------------

        Revised the documentation and updated the GROUPS description

Version 2.1 - 03-10-00
----------------------  
        Updrade the version number as required for the SAS V5

Version 2.0.2 - 2000-09-26(DB)
-------------------------------

	Update the .info files to comply to the GROUPS definition

Version 2.0.1 - 2000-06-27(DB)
-------------------------------
	SSC-SPR-1808 backcorr (version 2.0) - add make_backcorr.info file in the distribution. 
	+ Reactivate the test harness now that arfgen has settled a little bit, and make the code work with
	the arf files produced by arfgen.
	
Version 2.0 - 2000-05-27(DB)
----------------------------

	Major changes to the interface to follow latest release of arfgen
	(this fixes SSC-SPR-1686).  This implied several changes in the
 	code also, as some checks that do not need any longer to be done
 	in the task (e.g. shape of the extraction region, this is now done
 	in arfgen). Update of the documentation. Addition of the layout
 	file, the info file.
		
Version 1.7 - 2000-04-19(GV/SOC)
------------------------
	+ resubmission of 1.6, having removed build.tmp_ tht was causing the distcheck to fail.
	
Version 1.6 - 2000-04-18
------------------------

	The following SPRs have been fixed:
	
	SSC-SPR-1640 backcorr (version 1.5.1): documentation macros

	SSC-SPR-1628 backcorr (version 1.5.1): Task fails test harness
	
Version 1.5.1 - 2000-03-10 (GV/SOC)
-------------
	+ patched to cope with a problem in the dal. Do not absorb this
	patch in the development track.

Version 1.5 29/11/1999
----------------------

SSC-SPR-1358 fixed: In the test file I was testing for SAS_CCFDIR which is no
longer a environment variable needed

Version 1.4 28/09/1999
----------------------

The following SPR has been fixed:
