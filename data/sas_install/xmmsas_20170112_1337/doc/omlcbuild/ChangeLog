ChangeLog for omlcbuild
===============================
Version 1.40 -2014-06-01 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90):
	fixing the bug reported in SPR-0007207, namely, 
	applying the binning factor the imaging-mode window
	size; also a bug resulting in smaller output 
	count rates for the last time bin is fixed (the 
	size of the time bin was almost twice of what it
	should be)
Version 1.39.1 -2013-02-27 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90):
	Protected against possible subscript when using the
	imaging data to evaluate the background 
Version 1.39 -2012-11-12 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90):
	Protected against possible cycling in the subroutine
	SORT in the case of having NaN values in its input
Version 1.38 -2012-10-21 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90):
	The calculation of the background when using the imaging-mode
	window is made with the same photometry subroutines as
	in the task omdetect, the background map is created by 
	smoothing the imaging mode data
Version 1.37.4 -2011-02-19 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90).
 	The 0.5-pixel correction was modified once again as
	the previous modification was not complete.
Version 1.37.3 -2011-02-18 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90). 
	For some unknown reason the correction corresponding to 
	the SSC-SPR-6602 was switched off (commented). This was 
	causing a slight unusual variability of the source when
	its image was approaching to the lower Fast-windoe edge.
	The 0.5-pixel correction of the PSF position was restored
	(fixing the problem described in SSC-SPR-6650).
Version 1.37.2 -2010-03-26 (vny): documentation updated.
Version 1.37.1 -2010-03-16 (vny) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90). A subtle
	mistake of 0.5-pixels miscalculation of the source PSF position
	with respect to the edge of the Fast window is fixed. This mistake
	was causing about 10% variability of the source count rates when
	the source was touching the edge of the window and slightly changing
	its position with respect to this edge (by about 1 or 2 pixels), 
	SSC-SPR-6602.
Version 1.37 -2010-02-20 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Fixed a bug 
	related to the calculation of wrong background level when using
	the option bkgfromimage=yes  	
Version 1.36 -2010-01-31 (VNY)  +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)  Protected against 
	the crash because of the possibility of the missing block OMIMI1 
	in the accompanying imaging data file.
Version 1.35 -2010-01-26 (VNY) +(config/omlcbuild.par, src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)
	introducing two new input parameters: mod8corrupted 
	indicating that the Fast image is affected by the modulo-8 
	noise, and imageset giving the name of the auxiliary imaging
	data set to determine the background (this task version is
	not yet uploaded)
Version 1.34 -2009-09-08 (VNY) +(src/random_mod.f90, ommagnitude_mod.f90)
	The modules random_mod.f90 and ommagnitude_mod.f90 are
	removed as obsolete. The rest of the code remained unchanged.
Version 1.33.3 -2009-05-28 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) restoring 
	the limit of 2000 detected source after which the task does
	not produces light curves: SSC-SPR-6538. This limet
	is needed to avoid crashes due to lack of memory in difficlut
	cases.
Version 1.33.2 -2009-05-18 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)  A warning
	message is introduced for the case of finding too many 
	sources in the Fast window (SSC-SPR-6534)
Version 1.33.1 -2009-05-14 (VNY)  +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Cleaned
	from the debugging test remained from the previous upload
	(SSC-SPR-6530).
Version 1.33 -2009-04-30 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) A bug
	reported in SSC-SPR-6525 is fixed (trying do deallocate a
	pointer that was not allocated)
Version 1.32 -2009-03-13 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)	The Chi**2
	and Kolmogorov-Smirnov variability tests of the light 
	curve are introduced (passed from lcplot) in order to
	store the variability data in the source list product
	(SSC SCR-278).
Version 1.31.1 -2008-06-05 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) The values 
	in the RATE and BACKGROUND_RATE columns of the source-list
	table produced by omdetect are substituted by the corresponding
	raw count rates computed by omlcbuild in order to make these 
	values consistent with the corrected count rates computed 
	by the omlcbuild task (SSC-SPR-6474).
Version 1.31 - 2008-04-25 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) The use of the 
	theoretical calibration curve for coincidence-loss correction 
        is replaced with the use of the empirical polynomial coefficients 
	(i.e. the CAL routine CAL_omPhotoNatural is now called with the 
	logical parameter "empirical" set to troue instead of false). 
	Currently, the difference between the theoretial calibration 
	curve and the polynomial function is small but in the future the 
	calibration files might change (SSC-SPR-6456).	
Version 1.30 - 2008-02-13 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Using the CAL 
	routine for computing the time-dependent sensitivity correction 
	factor (SSC-SPR-3706) instead of the internal routine.	
Version 1.29.1 - 2007-06-07 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Suppressing the 
	background subtraction for mod-8 corrupted images (to fix SSC-SPR-3144)
	because the bright corrupted sources occupy practically the whole 
	Fast window.	
Version 1.29 - 2007-03-08 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) A switch
	between int*8 and int*18 data type is introduced for the
	quality flag in the source list table (produced by omdetect)
	in order to protect the task from crashing when working with
	the newer versions of omdetect (SSC-SPR-3650)
Version 1.28 - 2006-02-21 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) In the 
	computation of the average magnitude the negative counts 
	are taken into account, thus, removing a possible small
	bias in the magnitude (SSC-SPR-3587)
Version 1.27 - 2006-02-10 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) The computed time-
	dependent sensitivity correction factor is shown in the 
	header of the output file (SSC-SPR-3580)
Version 1.26 - 2006-02-10 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Introduced 
        the time-dependent sensitivity correction (SSC-SPR-3580)
Version 1.25 - 2005-09-09 (VNY) +(src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Protected 
	against the possible crash when using the extractions 
	region radius expressed in FWHM-units (SSC-SPR-3507)
Version 1.24.3 - 2004-05-15 (VNY) +(/src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) introduced 
	a rigorous algorithm for computing error bars for count rates
	(subroutine by S.Rosen) - fixed SSC-SPR-3337
Version 1.24.2 - 2004-04-28 (VNY) Protected against the possibility
	of crushing when dealing with negative count rates
	in cases when the image is badly affected by 
	coincidence losses and modulo-8 noise (SSC-SPR-3304).
Version 1.24.1 - 2004-03-01 (VNY) Protected against multiple 
	warning messages produced by CAL_omPhotoNatural in the 
	cases of bright sources, when the count rates exceed
	the permitted value defined by the frame time. Now,
	the task generates a single warning message indicating
	the percentage of the points with coincidence-loss 
	incorregeable count rates. Similar warning is placed into 
	the header of the output file (in the form of a comment
	line), SSC-SPR-3259
Version 1.24 - 2003-11-21 (VNY) DEPEND file updated to match the new
	version (3.0) of ssclib
Version 1.23 - 2003-06-16 (VNY) A small bug has been found (and fixed), 
	which might provoke a subscript error for some of the
	background timeseries (SSC-SPR-3131).
	
Version 1.22 - 2003-04-09 (VNY) 
	(+ /scr/omlcbuild_mod.f90) A small incorrectness in the
	interpolation of the last two poits of the background 
	light-curve is fixed (SSC-SPR-3103), which resulted in 
	underestimation of rates for these two points.
	
Version 1.21 - 2002-10-29 (VNY)
	(+ /scr/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Protection against the absence of
	the COINCLOSS_CORR column is introduced (SPR-3007)
	
Version 1.20 - 2002-10-25 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Corrected a bug, which was introduced
	at the end of September and which resulted in the impossibility
	to find the CORR_RATE_ERR column in the source list file
	(SSC-SPR-3004)
	
Version 1.19 - 2002-10-08 (VNY)
-------------------------------
	Additional check to improve robustness of the task has been
	added: the presence of the CORR_BACKGROUND_RATE column is checked
	before adding new columns after it to the file SWSRCLI (in order
	to avoid error messages in case on absence of this column).


Version 1.18 - 2002-09-26 (VNY) 
-------------------------------
	Updated to work with the modified format of SRCLIST-file
	(omdetect now doesn't produce the MAG-column; thus, omlcbuild 
	picks up this column only if it exists).
        Calculation of averaged instrumental magnitude of the source 
	has been modified: now first the count rates are averaged, and
	then the magnitude is calculated. Missed descriptions of 
	the columns in the RATE table are added.
	Source list table file is rearraged to have the same format as 
	that produced by OMICHAIN. 

Version 1.17 - 2002-05-23 (VNY) RA and DEC keywords in the TIMESR fits-file
	have been replaced with RA_OBJ and DEC_OBJ in order to make
	it easier to run BARYCEN on the light curve data	
	
Version 1.16 13.05.2002 (VNY) DEPEND and +/config/omlcbuild.par files 
	have been updated in order to work with PARAM-2.0
	
Version 1.15.6 09.05.2002 (VNY) A small shift to the psf-map is
        applied when calculating the scaling areas and coefficients. 
	This makes the psf-map coinsiding with the CCD-grid. The scaling
	factors are calculated more rogorousely.
	A bug, which restricted the timebinsize parameter, 
	has been fixed (SSC-SPR-2864)  
	
Version 1.15.5 24.04.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)  Further improvement of the
	source/background scaling factors: the algorithm for 
	estimation of the source extraction area is made consistent
	with that used in evselect (SSC-SPR-2826).
        The source counts error bars are protected against possible
	negative values of the errors appearing in the CAL_omPhotonatural
	function.
	
Version 1.15.4 18.04.2002 (VNY) 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Source and background scaling factors are
	corrected in order to solve a problem where counts rates for faint
	sources were overestimated (SSC-SPR-2826). Count rate error
	estimation has been improved.
	
Version 1.15.3 30.03.2002 (VNY) 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Check of the sourse
	rates table length is introduced (SSC-SPR-2814)
	
Version 1.15.2 29.03.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) default integer type of nSource
	variable replaced with int32-type in order to protect it from
	getting arbitrary values in  low memory mode (SSC-SPR-2814)

Version 1.15.1 28.03.2002 (VNY) 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) A bug accidentally introduced 
	on 22.03.2002 is removed
	
Version 1.15 28.03.2002 (VNY)
	VERSION changed for new SAS release
	
Version 1.14.11 28.03.2002 (VNY) 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Additional protection against
	zero-sized input source rate table (SSC-SPR-2814)
	
Version 1.14.10 27.03.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Protection against zero-sized
	input source rate table is introduced (SSC-SPR-2814)
	
Version 1.14.9 26.03.2002 (VNY) 
	(+DISTRIBUTION) Distribution has been changed from ssc to world

Version 1.14.8 22.03.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Memory allocation/deallocation 
	has been corrected (SSC-SPR-2814)
	
Version 1.14.7 13.02.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Background calculation has been
	improved: the fraction of PSF within the background extraction
	area has been taken into account. Background counts are corrected
	for this PSF fraction before subtracting background from the
	source counts. This could be essential for small source extraction
	radii (SSC-SPR-2745).
	
Version 1.14.6 08.02.2002 (VNY) 
	(+ /doc/omlcbuild_mod.f90)  Negative background counts are zeroed.
	These could appear as the result of interpolation between input 
	and output time bins when there are only a few background counts
	in the input data (SSC-SPR-2738). In this case the error bars for
	the zeroed counts are deduced from the background median.
	
Version 1.14.5 05.02.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /doc/omlcbuild_description.tex) Error section of the 
	description document file has been updated (SSC-SPR-2730)
	
Version 1.14.4 28.01.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /config/omlcbuild.par) Parameter type specifications have 
	been updated for obligatory parameters. 
	
Version 1.14.3 25.01.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) Scaling background counts to the source
	area has been improved. The source area is not circular for the
	sources near the OSW edge. Now the real shape and size of this 
	area is taken into account before scaling and subtracting
	background from the source counts (SSC-SPR-2715).

Version 1.13.2 23.01.2002 (VNY) 
	Same as V1.14.2 but for SAS-5.2.2 (ssclib has lower version)
	
Version 1.14.2 23.01.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) allocation of timeBack and timeSource
	arrays has been changed to satisfy dlocate routine:
	in dlocate these arrays are supposed to be starting from 1,
	but a 0 value is also read by it, that caused a subscript crash
	when the array has only one component (SSC-SPR-2702).

Version 1.14.1 17.01.2002 (VNY)
	(+ DEPEND) The same as V1.13.2, but ssclib is 2.0 in the dependencies

Version 1.13.2 17.01.2002 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) protected against the absence of data
	in the background RATES file (SSC-SPR-2702)
	
Version 1.14: 07.01.2002 (SRR, VNY) 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) (changed TIMEZERO value to 0.d0 in order
	to get values of time in the TIME column referred directly to
	MJDREF (SSC SPR-2680)). Dependencies have been updated.
	
Version 1.13.1: 08.01.2002 (VNY) changed TIMEZERO to 0.d0	

Version 1.13: 17.12.2001 (VNY)
	( DEPEND) dependencies file has been updated: mssllib V1.16
	replaced with V1.17 (SSC SPR-2675). TIME column has been added 
	to the output lightcurve FITS-file.
	
Version 1.12: 11.12.2001 (VNY) 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) fine agjustment of the PSF fraction
	calculation has been made: avoiding circles  from the neighbour
	sources are taken into account in accordance with recent changes
	in the OMREGION task. 	
	
Version 1.11: 10.12.2001 (VNY)
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) scaling background counts has been improved
	in order to get uniform lightcurve level for different lightcurve
	extraction areas (fixing SSC-SPR-2668).
	New parameter (binBpe) has been added to the call for the
	getFrameTime routine, in accordance with changes made by CB in
	this routine.
	VIGNET keyword in the output file header is set to 1.0 (no
	vignetting) in order to permit the proper use of this file by LCURVE.
	
Version 1.10.8: 19.11.2001
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)  3 additional keywords have been
	added to the output binary table extension (SRRADIUS, CLRADIUS
        and PHRADIUS, the source extraction radius, the coincidence loss
	correction radius and the photometry radius). 
	Also the parameter VIGNET has been replaced with PSF_FRAC keyword,
	because vignetting is defined in OGIP as a geometrical parameter
	(fraction of the area), but the task calculates the fraction of
	the PSF, not of the area. Respectively, PSF_CAPP keyword has been
	added, which means the correction for PSF_FRAC  was applied.

Version 1.10.7: 15.11.2001 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) fixing SPR-2629: background is being
	removed from the source counts before applying the PSF fraction 
	correction. Then it is restored in order to calculate correctly
	the Coincidence Lost Correction. And after that, the background is 
	subtracted again, but at this time from the area defined
	by CAL_Aperture_Radius. New keyword parameters have been added
	to the binary table header of the output FITS-file.

Version 1.10.6: 01.11.2001 
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90)  rectified count rates for the case of
	missed COINCIDENCE table in OM_PHOTONAT_XXXX.CCF to avoid the
	Illegal Count Rate message

Version 1.10.5: 31.10.2001
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) rectified the calculation of
	rateSourceErrOutArray and of the corrections for the PSF fraction
	which lies outside of the OSW.
	
Version 1.10.4: 29.10.2001
	(+ /src/omlcbuild_mod.f90) initialisation of countRateErrorMinus
	and countrateErrorPlus parameters has been introduced
	to the CorrectedCountRate function in order to rectify
	possible problems with high rate values.	

Version 1.10.3: 25.10.2001 initialisation of background rate error arrays
 was introduced (SPR-2611, high values for count rate errors) 

Version 1.10.2: 18.10.2001 make library dependencies updated to rectify 
 	static build

Version 1.10.1: 09.10.2001 Ammended DEPEND file to rectify a SOC build
 failure. Directories cleared out.	

Version 1.10: 24.09.2001
 Average magnitude of the source is added to the header of the
 output data set file. PSF_FRAC output parameter has been added
 to the attributes of the output light curve table (it means the source image fraction
 which is inside the OSW.  This parameter indicates whether or not the extracted
 light curve is affected by the source proximity to the edge of the field of view);
 checking and filtering the background and source counts for excessively high values.
 
Version 1.9.2: 08.08.2001
 Correction of the counts detected within the source radius is made
 now taking into account possible lost of photons at the edge of the OSW
 and using CAL_omGetPSFmap routine 

Version 1.9.1: 27.07.2001
   Two additional parameteres (sourcelistset & wdxset) have been mentioned in DOC
   
Version 1.9:   6.07.2001

 TimeStart parameter was corrected (TIMEZERO replaced with TSTART).
 The output table title has been changed from RATES to RATE (necessary for lcplot programme). 
 wdxSet input parameter is added (necessary for count rates correction ).
 sourceList input parameter is added (for count rates correction).
 Correction for count losses has been introduced.
 CorrectedCountRate function has been changed.
 Corrected the background estimation.
