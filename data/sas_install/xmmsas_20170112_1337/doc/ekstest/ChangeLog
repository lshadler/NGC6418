ChangeLog for ekstest
===============================

Open SPRs:

Version 2.7 - 2016-08-26 (EO)
-----------
	+ src/Makefile: After changing the preprocessor policy for all Fortran
	  compilations, added code here to allow for inclussion of 
	  NAG Fortran specific modules.
	+ DEPEND: Updated to sas-1.573. 


Version 2.6 - 2016-08-25 (EO)
-----------
	+ src/ekstest_mod.f90: Added an "ifdef NAGf90Fortran - endif"
	  preprocessor directive around "use f90_unix_proc" to allow its
	  loading only when NAG Fortran compiler is used. 
	+ DEPEND: Requires sas 1.572.


Version 2.5.1 - 2014-10-24 (RDS)
----------------------------
	Documentation update (lccorr -> epiclccorr) - SPR-7233


Version 2.5 - 2012-06-21 (NW)
-----------

	This version now tests for the case where all the good bins have
	counts equal to 0.0. If this is the case, the variability tests
	are not carried out. A warning is raised and 'NULL' values are
	entered into the keywords.  This closes SPR 6732.  A warning is
	also raised in ekstest is run with the chi-squared test and the
	fractional variability amplitude test, as in this case, the
	fractional variability is calculated for the total
	(source+background) lightcurve.  FVar and FVarErr are now also set
	to -1 if (S_squared - SigmaErr_squared) is equal to zero. This
	closes SPR  6723.  A new parameter has also been added,
	netlightcurve, so that the user can choose whether to carry out
	the fractional variability amplitude test on the net or total
	lightcurve.  The documentation has been revised to include the
	changes.
	

Version 2.4.1 - 2012-04-04 (NW)
-----------

	A new test, the fractional varability amplitude test, in response
	to SCR 329, has been added, with the results FVar and FVarErr,
	which are the fractional varability amplitude and the error on
	this value.  Also, the keywords written into the headers with the
	test results, now carry a 'NULL' value if there were too few bins
	for the test to be carried out, in response to SPR 6494.  The
	documentation has also been updated to outline the test and
	explain the 'NULL' value for the keywords.


Version 2.4 - 2010-01-18 (EO)
-----------
	+ src/ekstest_mod.f90: Included use f90_unix_proc to provide support for the
	  use of system subroutine (to execute shell commands).
	  The support comes through the use of NAG supported modules as they are provided
	  in the NAG library subdirectory.
	  To fullfil dependencies it is necessary to include the keyword NAGSUPMODS = yes 
	  in the src/Makefile.

Version 2.3.1 - 2009-05-12 (EO)
-------------
	+ Re-fixed DEPEND.

Version 2.3 - 2009-05-11 (EO)
-----------
	+ Fixed DEPEND file.

Version 2.2.5 -  2006-08-11 (NW)
----------------------------

      Changes made to the chi-squared test (now similar to IMS's lcchi2).


Version 2.2.4 -  2006-06-13 (NW)
----------------------------

      Change made to the chi-squared test (documented in the documentation 
      and the commented in the source code) as the reduced chi^2 values were 
      somewhat shifted from the expectation values in tests made with 2XMM.
       

Version 2.2.3 -  2006-03-14 (NW)
----------------------------

      Changed the version of ssclib in the DEPEND file for the release 
      track version.
       

Version 2.2.2 -  2006-03-07 (NW)
----------------------------

       Following SSC-SPR-3591 and tests carried out by AS and NAW it appears 
       that the incommplete gamma function available in the ssclib gives more 
       consistent results than the gamma_function_Q used originally in this 
       task and thus is now used in ekstest. 


Version 2.2.1 -  2006-02-03 (NW)
----------------------------

       Shortened the comments to the keywords:  KVSVSTAT, KVSVPROB, 
	CHI2PROB, FLARE, VARIATIO to have less than 40 characters, 
	following SPR-3578, where it was noted that the the comments 
	were too long for the available space.
	

Version 2.2 -  2005-09-14 (NW)
----------------------------

        Modified the chi-squared test as it was producing a negative 
	chi-squared statistics and thus incorrect probabilities, in 
	response to SSC-SPR-3516, Task generates negative chi-sq statistic.
	This occurred for datasets that were almost uniquely negative.  
	To rectify the problem, when calculating the chi-squared statistic, 
	the (O-E)**2 is divided by the absolute value of the Expected value.
	
	
Version 2.1 -  2005-04-19 (NW)
----------------------------

        Updated the documentation to make it clear that no variability
 	tests are carried out if there are insufficient good bins.
		
Version 2.0 -  2004-11-26 (NW)
----------------------------

	Added several new variability tests (flare and variation tests)
	along with parameters to control these tests.  The chi-squared
	test has been modified by S. Mateos.  The documentation has been
	rewritten.

Version 1.3.6 -  2004-09-03 (NW)
----------------------------

	Small code change so that ekstest deals with the NULLS in the same
	way as elcplot (version 1.2.6).

Version 1.3.5 -  2004-08-13 (NW)
----------------------------

        Small code change - now keeps background counts = 0.0 as well.

Version 1.3.4 -  2004-08-10 (NW)
----------------------------

	Added missing line necessary to stop the new header information
	being written into the given input file (only written to a new
	file).  Also changed error calculation for the total counts, when
	they are recovered from the net and background counts.

Version 1.3.3 -  2004-08-09 (NW)
----------------------------

	This version makes sure that ONLY the NULL values are taken out
	and not the 0.0 values as well.  Ekstest also tests to make sure
	that total counts are not negative (whatever the nature of the
	input file) and also raises an error if no screen output is
	requested and nor is a new output file specified.  The
	documentation has also been updated.
	

Version 1.3.2 -  2004-08-02 (NW)
----------------------------

	This version now keeps all negative net counts.  


Version 1.3.1 -  2004-07-27 (NW)
----------------------------

        The kolmogorov-smirnov test code has been revised (now based on
	numerical recipes code) and a new boolean parameter (twodists) has
	been introduced so that the user can choose to carry out a two
	distribution KS-test (counts verses background) or a single
	distribution KS-test (net counts).  Some warnings have been
	revised.  The documentation has been updated.
	

Version 1.3 -  2004-07-01 (NW)
----------------------------

	- Ekstest can now write a new file (with the results contained in
	the header of the new file rather than the original file) and/or
	write the results to the screen. The documentation has also been
	updated.

Version 1.2 -  2004-06-14 (NW)
----------------------------

	- Updated DEPEND file so that ekstest builds correctly.

Version 1.1 -  2004-05-28 (NW)
----------------------------

	- Made the GTI file parameter an optional one as well as checking
	whether the input file contains the background subtracted
	lightcurve or the unsubtracted lightcurve.  If it is background
	subtracted ekstest calculates the unsubtracted lightcurve (and the
	associated errors) to use for the variability test.  Also changed
	the Makefile and the test so that both the test harness and the
	dependency checks are passed in the SAS build, as well as updated
	the documentation.


	
Version 1.0 -  2004-05-19 (NW)
----------------------------

	- Ekstest, a version of lcplot which contains only the variability
	tests and namely the kolmogorov-smirnov test, where the results
	are written directly into the header information.
	


	
Version 0.1 -  2004-05-14 (NW)
----------------------------
- Directory structure created by pkgmaker.
