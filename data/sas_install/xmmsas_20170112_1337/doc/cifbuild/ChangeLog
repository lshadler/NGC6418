ChangeLog for cifbuild
======================

Version 4.8 - 2012-12-18 (AI)
-----------	
	+ Cal library depence added.
	
Version 4.7.2 - 2011-02-16 (AI)
-----------
	+ CalIndex::removeConstituent: This method erase an element of a 
	class attribute using an iterator. Then the iterator is used 
	and produce a seg fault in OSX (no in Linux... strange). 
	We simply do not use the iterator after the erase call.
	
Version 4.7.1 - 2004-03-18 (RDS)
-----------
	+ config/cifbuild.lyt - included missing parameters.
	
Version 4.7 - 2003-05-30 (GV)

	+ (cifbuild.cc) remove a couple of remaining ends.
	
Version 4.5 - 2003-02-14 (GV)
-----------
	+ (cifbuild.cc) Make the name of the CIF available to calling meta-tasks.

Version 4.4 - 2003-02-13 (GV)
-----------
	+ (cifbuild.cc) Do not delete const Odf *, or cifbuild cannot be
	called in a meta-task.
	
Version 4.3 - 2002-09-16 (GV)
-----------
	+ Code adjustments for gcc-3.1
	
Version 4.2 - 2002-05-13 (GV)
-----------
	+ Updated for param-2.0
	
Version 4.1 - 2001-12-21 (GV)
-----------
	+ (test/testcifbuildwitheval.cc) extend to also test mif generation.
	+ (CalIndexSet.cc VirtualCcfConstituent.cc) make sure EVALDATE is
	written/read correctly. Make the column in the CIF/MIF blank when
	EVALDATE does not exist.
	+ (cifbuild_description.tex) updated with excerpts from the new
	ODF ICD (issue 4.0).

	
Version 4.0 - 2001-09-07 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/CcfConstituent.h) introduce endvaldate() and
	hasEndvaldate(). Implementation in {Common, Real,
	Virtual}CcfConstituent. If a CCF constituent has the attribute
	EVALDATE this is read in.
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) change container type from list<CcfConstituent
	*> to vector.
	Makes use of the notion of end of validity date, if such a date
	exists in the CCF constituents.
	+ (test/testcifbuildwitheval.cc) test harness for CCF constituents
	with and end of validity date. Makes use of data in
	mytestcc-with-endvaldate. 
	
Version 3.2.1 - 2001-06-10 (GV)

	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) re-organize messages.
	+ (" ") introduce warning NoCcfPath (also documented in
	doc/cifbuild_description.tex).
	+ (tools/findcalindex.cc) debug tool.
	+ (doc/cifbuild_description.tex) make it clear that if a master

	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) implement the logic required by the parameter
	above.

-------------
	+ (config/cifbuild.lyt) add missing parameters.
	
Version 2.4 - 2000-10-10 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) was not working when asked to build a CIF from
	a MIF (SOC-SPR-1764).
	+ (src/VirtualCcfConstituent.*) add method to return category. The
	category is taken to be the value of the CATEGORY attribute in the
	CALINDEX table.

Version 2.3 - 2000-10-04 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) pass the analysis and observation dates to the
	CIF. They are stored as ANALDATE and OBSVDATE.
	+ (src/CalIndex*) changes to make the above possible.
	
Version 2.2 - 2000-09-27 (GV)
----------- 
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) if using a MIF to build a CIF, the MIF can be
	on a readonly medium now.
	+ (src/CalIndexSet.{cc,h}) add bool readonly to one of the
	constructors, so that the above can work.

	withmissingfile and missingfile.

Version 2.1 - 2000-09-26 (GV)
----------- 
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) if building a MIF, observation and analysis
	date are set to Jan 1, 1990 and now respectively.
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) ask the observation date the OAL only if it is
	trying to build a CIF. The MIF does not require an active ODF.
	+ (src/CalIndexSet.cc) write CCF attributes in the output set.

Version 2.0 - 2000-09-22 (GV)
----------- 
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) can read the observation date from
	the ODF currently active. This behavior is controlled by
	(config/cifbuild.par) withobservationdate. This implements
	SCR-0008.
	+ (tools/cifdiff.cc) add parameter withfile to toggle writing to
	file or to stdout.
	
Version 1.14 - 2000-08-15 (GV)
------------
	+ (config/cifbuild.info) fix typo in GROUPS entry.
	
Version 1.13.1 - 2000-06-23 (GV)

	inheritance public instead of vrtual public (SOC-SPR-840).

Version 1.13 - 2000-05-22 (GV)
------------
	+ update for new dal that enforces DATE/CREATOR being reserved
	attributes.
	+ add task info files.

------------
	+ typos in documentation removed.

Version 1.11 - 2000-04-20 (GV)
------------
	+ package name changed to ciftools. VERSION and everything else
	carried over from cifbuild. 
	+ (tools/cifremove.cc) add warning(NoMatchingCcfConstituent).
	+ (  "            "  ) allow list of scopes/types.
	+ (                  ) add error(ParameterCountMismatch).
	+ update test harness and config file for the above.
	+ update documentation for the above and comments from review.
	+ cifremove approved.
	+ cifinsert documentation updated after review.
	+ cifinsert approved.
Version 1.10 - 2000-04-11 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) add cif->sort(CcfConstituent::compare) in case
	the cif is being appended to, so the file list is always ordered.
	
Version 1.9 - 2000-04-05 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/CalIndex.*) add:
	  virtual bool removeConstituent(CcfConstituent * c)
	  virtual bool removeConstituent(const string type, const string scope)
	+ (src/CalIndex.*) addConstituentFromSet(string) implemented.

----------- 
	+ (cifdiff.cc) lists the difference between two CIFs.
	+ (src/CommonCcfConstituent.cc) close SPR 1143: at some stage
	operator< on CcfConstituent was left broken.
	+ (src/cifbuild.cc) make list of potential CCF constituents uniqe,
	to prevent confusing messages about duplicate entries in the
	CIF. This required the addition of a static member function
	(compare) to CcfConstituent.h.
	+ (src/CommonCcfConstituent.cc) when examining CCF constituents
	all attributes as per CCF ICD must be present, or the constituent
	will be discarded. It no longer issues warnings at this stage,
	only messages. Warnings are issued during the compilation of the cif.
	+ (cifbuild.cc) now write out the cif even if it is empty.
	+ (test) extend test harness.
	
Version 1.7 2000-02-08 (GV)

Version 1.5 1999-11-04
-----------
	+ (cifbuild.{cc,par}) add parameter --ignorecategory to indicate
	that the CCF constituent's category should be ignored.

Version 1.4 1999-10-08
-----------
	+ after the sort, cifbuild extracts CCF constituents in reverse
	order, so that later (in the CCF sort sense) constituents are
	chosen first.
	+ add support for append mode (see doc).
	+ add lsccf, a utility to print out a summary of CCF constituent
	properties. 

Version 1.3 1999-08-19
-----------
	+ made a few more changes to make the task take the correct
	decision when some of the attributs not used by the DAL are
	missing from the CCF constituents.

Version 1.2 1999-08-19
-----------
	+ table name changed in accordance with CAL documentation. It was
