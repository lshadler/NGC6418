Description
</H1>

<P>
The primary purpose of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">omdetect</SPAN> is to perform source-detection on either <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OM IMAGING</SPAN> (images produced by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommodmap</SPAN>), 
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">FAST</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">GRISM</SPAN> mode product images. From version <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5.17</SPAN> it also performs upon images produced by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommosaic</SPAN>. 
For <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">GRISM</SPAN> images the sources are  the zero and first order spectra. For <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OM IMAGING</SPAN> mode data it also performs 
photometry on the detected sources and sets source flags. Its primary output file is a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">FITS</SPAN> file containing 
a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SRCLIST</SPAN> table that contains various parameters of the detected sources.

<P>
The following provides an overall description of how <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">omdetect</SPAN> works in the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">IMAGING</SPAN> mode.

<P>
The image is first loaded into memory from the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">PRIMARY</SPAN> FITS block in the file and also the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">QUALITY</SPAN> image.
For image files produced by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommodmap</SPAN> the latter image will have been constructed by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">omcosflag</SPAN> and provides a map of where 
bad-pixels are. For image files produced by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommosaic</SPAN>, the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">QUALITY</SPAN> image contains additional information about
pixel-quality issues. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Omdetect's</SPAN> detection algorithms will ignore any  
image pixel in which the corresponding quality-pixel is 1 (ie a bad pixel) and during the photometry stage it will 
use it to set bit 0 of the source-quality flag for sources containing one or more bad pixels. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Omdetect</SPAN> computes a background image in order to identify pixels that may be part
of a source. It uses two different algorithms for detecting <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">point-like</SPAN>  and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">extended</SPAN> sources and 
a source is classified as either one from a comparison of its computed width with  that of the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">PSF</SPAN> for the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OM</SPAN> filter width. 
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Omdetect</SPAN> uses two internal 2-d integer images  to record the pixels that are assigned to <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">point-like</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">extended</SPAN> 
sources (the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">plevel</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">elevel</SPAN> images, respectively).

<P>
The point-source detection algorithm is run first, and for each pixel higher than a specified value above the  
local background value various checks are made to see if the pixel could be part of a 
source. If a likely source is found its position and shape parameters are computed by moments and its classification is determined.
Usually the source will be classified as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">point-like</SPAN> (since this algorithm is tuned for such sources) and the pixels on the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">plevel</SPAN> 
image that are assigned to the source are set equal to the source number.  Occasionally the source will be classified
as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">extended</SPAN> and then the pixels on the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">elevel</SPAN> image that are assigned to the source are set equal to the source number. 
The algorithm makes many passes over the image, using a number of different source-identification algorithms tuned to 
pick up different types of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">point-like</SPAN> sources (eg sources surrounded by mod-8 pattern, sources that have close neighbours), to 
pick up as many sources as possible. This algorithm largely overcomes the problem of locating sources contaminated
by scattered light features. The pixels are examined in the order of decreasing pixel
brightness, and this overcomes other problems due to strong mod-8 patterns, etc.

<P>
The extended-source detection algorithm works by examining groups of pixels above a background threshold. Various
checks are made to ensure that the group of pixels is not just part of a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mod-8 pattern</SPAN>
or part of a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">scattered-light feature</SPAN>. If a likely source is found, its position 
and shape parameters are computed by moments and it is classified as either <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">point-like</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">extended</SPAN>.
Usually the source will be classified as the latter, and the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">elevel</SPAN> image pixels assigned to the source are set 
equal to the source number. Occasionally a faint source may be classified as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">point-like</SPAN>, and in this case 
the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">pelevel</SPAN> image pixels assigned to the source are set  equal to the source number. When the detection process is 
finished a check is made on <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">extended sources</SPAN> to see if they can be split into two or more sources.

<P>
Having obtained a list of sources, comprising of various parameters such as positions,
extension flags and shapes, aperture-photometry is then performed on each source to
produce a count-rate for each source that is consistent with the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OM
calibration</SPAN> procedure. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Omdetect</SPAN> does not compute instrumental magnitudes from
these count-rates, and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommag</SPAN> needs to be run using the output source-list
to accomplish this. Flags are also added to make the user aware of any potential
problems with the photometry of a particular source.   

<P>
An output source-list file is produced containing source positions, parameters measuring their size and shape, 
source count-rates, various other photometry parameters and source flags. A count-rate limit is 
written to the source list file header (keyword CRLIMIT) reflecting the mean 5 
sigma above background detection threshold for the image. When the input image is a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mosaiced sky-image</SPAN>, 
the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SRCLIST</SPAN> table in the ouput file will contain columns for the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">RA</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">DEC</SPAN> coordinates. These
coordinates will have been computed using the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CRPIX1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
