ChangeLog for omdetect
=========================

Version 5.36.1 - 2016-11-18 (RDS)
-------------------------------			
	+ (src/omdetectdetection_mod.f90) set default value to 
	                                  .true. in the function
				          backgroundGradientOkay1 

Version 5.36 - 2016-09-21 (AI)
-------------------------------			
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) (nx,ny) variables cast to integer kind 9 
	to avoid multiplication overflow in ImagingDetection subroutine

Version 5.35 - 2016-07-18 (AI)
-------------------------------			
	+ (rc/parameters_mod.f90) gfortran compatibility changes applied.

Version 5.34.1 - 2016-01-12 (AI)
-------------------------------			
	+ (src/sourceanalysis_mod.f90)  use modules reordering to avoid error  
	with NAG fortran compiler 6.2
	
Version 5.34 - 2014-03-19 (VNY)
-------------------------------		
	+src/omdetect_mod.f90: the calculation of the coincidence-loss
	corrected error bars is modified by using the postulation of the
	s/n ratio being the same for the corrected count rates 
	as for the raw count rates; Setting to NULL the corrected count rates 
	for the sources with raw+nkg count rate >0.97 counts per frame.
Version 5.33.2 - 2013-11-12 (VNY)
-------------------------------		
	+src/omdetect_mod.f90: Fixed the problem of changing variable
 	photometryRadius reported in SSC-SPR-0007155. The problem consisted
	in the fact that the variable apertureRadius declared as a local
	variable in omdetect was also declared as a global variable in the 
	library mssllib. This was leading to the same memory location
	for the variables photometryRadius and apertureRadius, which 
	was wrong.
Version 5.33.1 - 2013-11-10 (VNY)
-------------------------------		
	+src/omdetect_mod.f90: added two new columns for the background
	errors, BKG_RATE_ERR and CORR_BKG_RATE_ERR by using mssllib
	module omsrctable_mod.f90; updated the calculation of source and 
	background count rate errors to fix the problem reported
	in SSC-SPR-7153. Introduced the rounding the source x- and y-
	coordinates to the accuracy of 0.1 pixel size in order to make 
	the source photometry output similar on different 
	computers.
Version 5.33 - 2013-08-16 (VNY)
	+(src/omdetect_mod.f90) Skipping the check of the binning
	factor for mosaiced images as this check is designed for 
	detector-coordinate images only.
--------------------------------
	+(doc/omdetect_description.tex) Documentation corrected		
--------------------------------	
Version 5.32 - 2013-07-13 (VNY) 
--------------------------------
	+(doc/omdetect_description.tex) Documentation corrected	
--------------------------------	
Version 5.31 - 2013-07-11 (VNY) 
--------------------------------
	+(src/omdetect_mod.f90) Introduced the check of the binnig factor
	by using the header-based window size and the actual window size. 
--------------------------------	
Version 5.30 - 2012-11-23 (VNY) 
--------------------------------
	+(src/omdetect._mod.f90, src/omdetectdetection_mod.f90) Improved the
	algorithm for detecting large scattered-light features (in terms
	of computer time usage).
--------------------------------	
Version 5.29 - 2012-11-23 (VNY) 
--------------------------------
 	+(src/omdetect._mod.f90, src/omdetectdetection_mod.f90) Included
	the detection of large scattered-light features (large extended
	sources) whose masks are transferred to the quality map extension
	of the input image file; the sources within these regions 
	are flagged as sitting on an extended source (bit 8 of the 
	quality flag).
--------------------------------	
Version 5.28 - 2011-11-20 (VNY) 
-------------------------------- 
	+(ompsfphotometry_mod.f90) Further improvements of the 
	psf-photmetry algorithm: the calculation of the slope of the 
	psf-profile is removed; the psf-photometry of close neighbouring
	sources is made by using the calibration PSF from CAL
--------------------------------	
Version 5.27.2 - 2011-02-19 (VNY) 
-------------------------------- 
	+(config/omdetect.par): the use of the parameter psfphotometryenabled
	is restricted for test purposes only; documentation updated.
--------------------------------	
Version 5.27.1 - 2010-12-10 (VNY) 
--------------------------------	
	+(/test/createtest.f90) Changes in calling the random_seed routine
	introduced by Eduardo Ojero to make the task working on 64-bit 
	machines (SSC-SPR-6639).
--------------------------------	
Version 5.27 - 2010-11-14 (VNY)
--------------------------------	
	+(ompsfphotometry_mod.f90) The psf-photmetry algorithm is improved:
	a few bugs are fixed; new method for calculating the slope of 
	the psf-profile is introduced; the least-squares solution is removed 
	from one of the subroutines to accelerate the calculation.
--------------------------------	
Version 5.26 - 2010-11-07 (VNY)
--------------------------------
	+(ompsfphotometry_mod.f90) Fixed a bug in the subroutine 
	findNeighbours, which  might cause a crash due to the usage of
	unallocated pointer;
	+(omdetect_mod.f90) a new parameter (neighboursforpsfphotometry)
	is introduced to get more flexibility in implementing the 
	PSF-photometry of sources
Version 5.25 - 2010-10-17 (VNY)
--------------------------------
	+(config/omdetect.par): new parameter (psfphotometryset) 
	is introduced to separate the source lists with the aperture photometry
	and PSF-photometry. The range of the parameter 
	psfphotometryenabled is returned to normal (yes/no) as now the 
	aperture photometry source list is not overwritten when
	PSF-photometry is requasted.
	+(src/omdetect_mod.f90, ompsfphotometry_mod.f90, omphotometry_mod.f90)
	The algorithm for PSF-photometry is improved. 
Version 5.24.5 - 2010-04-20 (VNY)
--------------------------------
	+(config/omdetect.par): The range of the parameter 
	psfphotometryenabled is restricted to a single "no" value
	because the performance of the task using the psf-photometry
	is not yet satisfactory (following the recommendation of SAS-CCB 
	panel of 2010-04-20).
Version 5.24.4 - 2010-04-02 (VNY)
--------------------------------	
	+(src/parameters_mod.f90): Better protection against
	source duplication in the Fast-mode detection is introduced
	(further fixing of SSC-SPR-6601).
Version 5.24.3 - 2010-04-01 (VNY)
--------------------------------
	+(src/omdetect_mod.f90, omdetectdetection_mod.f90, 
	parameters_mod.f90): modified the algorithm for calculation
	of the source position in the case of processing Fast-mode
	images. Instead of using the moments the coordinates are
	obtained by weighting the image pixels around the brightest
	source pixel (fixing SSC-SPR-6605).
Version 5.24.2 - 2010-03-19 (VNY) 
--------------------------------	
	+(src/omdetect_mod.f90): Introduced checking of the 
	source proximity to each other in order to avoid 
	duplicated detections of the same source in the 
	Fast mode (SSC-SPR-6601)
Version 5.24.1 - 2010-03-03 (VNY) 
--------------------------------
	+(src/ompsfphotometry): introduced 
	the re-calculation of the coincidence-loss correction factor
	after implementing the psf-photometry

	and maxrawcountrate for this purpose
	(SCR's 289 and 295). Introduced new
	parameter backgroundmethod for changing
	the method to determine the background.

Version 4.19.4 - 2004-02-27 (CB)
--------------------------------
	A small modification has been made to the grism-detection routine,
	so that the actual source-detection routine is run 3 times with
	decreasing image threshold values. This reduces the risk of
	bright detected spectra being contaminated by scattered light

	(fixes SPR 3261).
	
	
Version 4.19.3 - 2004-02-19 (CB)
--------------------------------
	Ammended omdetectdetection_mod.f90 to carry out another search

	method and pixels in the vicinity of sources excluded (fixes SPR
	2780). In doing this the magnitudes are more reliable (fixes SPR
	2731). Background map found to be okay (SPR 2764).
	
	

Version 3.5.2   2002-01-28 (CB)
	+ (src/omdetectphotometry_mod.f90) Removed some write statements.
	Test harness ammended to prevent occasional failure when in fact
	program is working satisfactorily.

Version 3.5.1   2002-01-28 (CB)
	+ (src/omdetectphotometry_mod.f90) Modification made to trap a
	problem that occurred (SPR 2682) analysing a strange image that 
	caused the source detection algorithm to go hay-wire, resulting 
	in a crash- One initially detected source was subsequently
	analysed and split into about 80 sources (normally no more than
	3), causing an array bound crash. If this problem now occurs 
	omdetect will add the keyword "SRC_DET" to the source list file
	header, mentioning the problem- warning message also output 
	(Fixes SPR 2682).
	
Version 3.5 2002-08-02 (CB) 
___________
	DEPEND file ammended for SSCLIB

Version 3.4 2001-15-12 (CB) Minor improvements to source
        detection made - code for smoothing images modified so that a rectangle
	instead of a box can be made. Documentation ammended (SPR 2653)   

======================
Version 3.3 - 2001-11-22 (JBa)
------------
        + (doc/omdetect_description.tex): fixed documentation



Version 3.2.5   2001-11-02 (VNY)
	+ (test/createtest.f90, test/checkoutput.f90) calculation of exp
	and division operations are made more robusts
	
Version 3.2.4   2001-10-30 (CB)
	+ (test/checkoutput.f90) Array subscripting error rectified. 
	
Version 3.2.3   2001-10-23 (VNY)
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) A protection against negative values
	was introduced before calculation of log and lnFactrl 
Version 3.2.2   2001-09-20 (CB)
	+ (src/omdetectsourceparams_mod.f90) Negative
	background-subtracted pixel values reset to zero to prevet
	crashing (fixes SPR 2605).
	
Version 3.2.1   2001-09-20 (CB)
	+ (src/omdetectsourceparams_mod.f90) Sources were being rejected
	if the source semi-minor axis squared, computed from the moments, 
	was negative (usually a the source is close to another one). A minor
	modification has been made to overcome this (fixes SPR 2602). 
        Test harness modified to conduct a test for the fast-chain. 	
Version 3.2   2001-09-20 (VNY)
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) A bug in the sourcePars array indexation has been fixed. 
Version 3.1   2001-09-17 (VNY)
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Correction of X and Y positions 
	was introduced for the cases when the source is near 
	the edge of the field of view (only for the FAST mode).
	
Version 3.0.5   2001-08-20 (CB)
	+ (test/createtest.f90) The dimensions of the quality array
	set equal to those of the image (instead of 1, 1 as in 
	previous versions)- fixes SPR 2539. Some compiler warning messages
        eradicated.                     

	
Version 3.0.4   2001-08-07 (VNY, CB)
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90)    A code in the COMPUTEMODE routine
	which  causes underestimation of the background median value
        has been removed. The parameter TOLERANCE has been set to 1 pixel
	for the IMAGING mode and to the maximum of two sources semi major
	axis for the FAST mode chain (within the code eliminating 
        multiple sources). omMode variable has been introduced to
	differentiate FAST and IMAGING modes. In order to improve the
	program's detection ability, negative values appearing after 
	background substraction have been zeroed (in the detection routine)
        + (config/omdetect.par) Default value for contrast parameter set
	to 0.001 to improve source detection in regions contaminated by
	scattered light (fixes SPR 2515). Bug in background computation
	fixed (also SPR 2515).


                       	
Version 3.0.3   2001-07-28 (CB)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) The photometry aperture radius is now
	fixed at 12 pixels, instead of being obtained from a call to get
	CAL_getApertureRadius (fixes SPR 2495). 


Version 3.0.2   2001-07-24 (CB)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) In the first call to subroutine
	"smoothImage", the smoothing parameter has been changed back to
	its original value of 3 (it had been changed for the fast-chain
	but further tests have shown that the value 3 works okay for the fast-chain)  (fixes SPR 2490). 

Version 3.0.1   2001-07-24 (CB)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Array bounds for quality image array changed to
	start at 0 instead of 1 (fixes SPR 2482) 
	
	
Version 3.0   2001-07-20 (CB/VNY) Module "omdetectphotometry_mod.f90" added
        to do aperture photometry on the sources (SPR 2091). Quality flag for each
	source now set by omdetect (SPR 2092). Extra columns (source aperture radius,
	x and y positions) output by omdetect so that ommag can correctly
	convert the source counts to instrumental magnitudes. The extended
	flag for each source now set by comparing the gaussian-fit
	parameters with those fitted to the point-spread function. The
	confusion flag for each source set according to the distance to
	its nearest neighbour source. Boxscale parameter now should be 
	given in arcsecs (SPR 2094). Program split-up into more modules to
	make it easier to read and maintain. Some minor changes made to
	make it run faster. Program now works with filter "MAGNIFIER" (SPR 2192) 
        Algorithm for searching for overlapping sources modified. Some
	momory leaks rectified. The improvement in the photometry is
	quantified in the tex file.

	
Version 2.24.2 2001-05-01 (CB)
	Limiting plate count rate ammended so that the limiting counts per pixel is
	multiplied by the photometry aperture area (fixes SPR
	2090). Aperture radius obtained from CAL routine. Parameter
	"device" deleted and all pgplot code. Program also tidied up.
	
Version 2.24.1 2001-02-06 (CB)
	Removed old versions of omdetect.
	
Version 2.24   2001-01-11 (CB)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Program checks that mediam background >
	0.0 before calculating background limitomng count rate (fixes bug
	- SPR 2204)

Version 2.23   2001-01-11 (CB)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Program now stores the source background
	count rates in the source-list file so that ommag can correctly
	apply the corrections for coincidence losses, etc.


Version 2.22.2   2000-11-08 (JPDM)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Program now calculates the
	detection-limit count rate and outputs the value to the
	source-list file.

Version 2.22.1   2000-10-25 (JPDM)
        + (src/omdetectsourceparams_mod.f90) Fix argument list error in
        simplex code and rewrote nexttopostion to nearestNeighbourNewParam
	to remove recursive nature of call (fix run time problem at estec)

Version 2.22   2000-10-03 (AMK)
------------------------------
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Added 'White ' to the list of possible
	filters. Just covers the lower case of 'WHITE' which has been seen in
	cycle 0070 SAS file. Filter WHITE is also in the list.
	
Version 2.20   2000-10-03 (AMK)
------------------------------
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) REplace call to getFilterId by OAL call
	to filterIdToInt
	
Version 2.19   2000-0904  (AMK)
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) Reinstated the call to CAL_omGetPLa
	teScale.
	
Version 2.19   2000-0904  (AMK)
	+ (src/omdetect_mod.f90) added code to read in the quality array. 
	The task will have to be modified eventually so that the quality
	array is processed in order to deal with image pixels that are zero
	in the flatfield. Currently these problem image pixels have been
	sent to zero. 

Version 2.18.3 2000-06-22 (JPDM)
        + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) changed tolerance for extent flag (SSC-SPR-1865)

    + (config/omdetect.info) fixed VISIBLE keyword (SSC-SPR-1859)
    
Version 2.18.1 2000-06-16 (AMK/JPDM)
--------------
    + (config/omdetect.info) added (SSC-SPR 1701)`
    + (src/omdetect_mod.f90) changed RA/DEC from 32 to 64 bit numbers in output file. (SSC-SPR-1769)
