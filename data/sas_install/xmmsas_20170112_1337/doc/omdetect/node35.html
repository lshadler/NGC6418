Point-like Sources (non-mosaiced images)</A>
</H2>

<P>
After the source-detection algorithms have finished, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">omdetect</SPAN> will compute
raw count-rates for each detected source. For point-sources (ie those sources having
widths consistent with those of the point-spread function) the count-rates
are obtained by aperture photometry. For binned and unbinned images the aperture is 6 and 12 
pixels, respectively. For a source with one or more neighbours that may be partly  within the aperture,
a smaller aperture will be used and its size is determined from the distance to its nearest neighbour.
The actual aperture radii (unbinned pixels) that were used in the photometry are given in the
column <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">APERTURE</SPAN> of the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SRCLIST</SPAN> table of the output source-list table.

<P>
The background is subtracted using the pixels within an annulus region.  For the optical 
filters the inner and outer diameters of the annulus are 8 and 13 pixels for binned images, respectively, 
and 14 and 25 pixels for unbinned images, respectively. For the UV filters the inner and outer diameters 
of the annulus are 19.5 and 22 pixels for binned images, respectively, and 37 and 42 pixels for 
unbinned images, respectively. These values are stored as the fits keywords <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">INNBCKAN</SPAN> 
and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OUTBCKAN</SPAN>  in the primary header of the output source-list file 

<P>
When each point-source has had its photometry parameters computed, those with
a significance of less than or equal to 10 sigma have their photometry re-computed
using an aperture of 6 unbinned pixels, in order to reduce the errors due
to the background noise.

<P>
These ``raw'' count-rates have to be corrected for coincidence-loss, dead-fraction and
the time-dependent sensitivity degradation before instrumental magnitudes can be computed
(using the task <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommag</SPAN>).  <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Please note that the time-dependent sensitivity and dead-time corrections
are applied by ommag.</SPAN> The reference aperture through which <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">XMM-OM</SPAN> coincidence-loss factors have been calibrated 
have a 12 pixel diameter. All raw count-rates obtained through reduced-size apertures are corrected to the 
reference aperture sizes using a calibrated PSF curves-of-growth, before coincidence-loss correction. 
The photometric zero-point calibration was performed on a 12 pixel diameter aperture in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">U</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">B</SPAN> and
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">V</SPAN> filters, and a 35 pixel diameter one in <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">UVW2</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">UVM2</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">UVW1</SPAN> filters. Therefore,
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">UV</SPAN> point-source count-rates are extrapolated by curve-of-growth to 35 pixels before photometric calibration.

<P>
The following summarizes the procedure used to correct the source extracted count-rates
for coincidence-losses-

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Extrapolate (if necessary) the source count-rate to the 12 unbinned
pixel aperture, using the point-spread function for the filter.
</LI>
<LI>Extrapolate (if necessary) the background count-rate to the 12 unbinned
pixel aperture, by using the scaling factor (144 / aperture <!-- MATH
 \begin{math}
radius^2
\end{math}
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$radius^2$"></SPAN>).
</LI>
<LI>Apply a coincidence-loss correction to the total (source+background) count-rate.
</LI>
<LI>Apply a coincidence-loss correction to the background count-rate.
</LI>
<LI>Subtract the background coincidence-loss corrected count-rate from the
coincidence-loss corrected total count-rate- this is the coincidence-corrected source-count rate.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Please note that these coincidence-loss corrections do not contain the factor
1/(1-deadfraction).</SPAN>

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The following further corrections will then be applied by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ommag</SPAN>-

<P>

<UL>
<LI>If a UV filter, a further point-spread function correction is applied to extrapolate
the source count-rate from 12 to 35 unbinned pixels.
</LI>
<LI>The ``dead-time correction`` - 1/(1-deadtime)
</LI>
<LI>The correction for the time-dependent sensitivity degradation.
</LI>
</UL>
