Version 2.5.3 - 2014-10-24 (RDS)
----------------------------
        Documentation update (lccorr -> epiclccorr) - SPR-7235

Version 2.5.2 - 2012-19-04 (NW)
----------------------------

        The coordinates given in the header of the output of elcplot 
	are now displayed to .00 for RA and .0 for Dec. even when the 
	(arc)seconds are inferior to 10, as requested in SPR 6715.
	

Version 2.5.1 - 2012-04-04 (NW)
----------------------------

        The coordinates given in the header of the output of elcplot 
	are now fixed to .00 for RA and .0 for Dec., as requested in SPR 6495.
	


Version 2.5 - 2006-12-12 (NW)
----------------------------

        To solve the problem that the declination given in the header of the
        output plot had the minus sign missing if the declination was between
        0 and -1 (SSC-SPR-3636) a further character has been added to include
        the minus sign for this case (fortran 90 does not seem to accept any
        -0 values)


Version 2.4 - 2006-10-16 (NW)
----------------------------	


	Ensured that the plotted bin size is given as an integer multiple 
	of the data bin size (closes SSC-SPR-3629).


Version 2.3 - 2005-10-21 (IMS/LUX, NW)
----------------------------	

      - The task seg faulted on some data sets (spr 3524), on entrance to
        subroutine make_one_plot. This appears to be more f95 sillies. I 
	removed some evaluations which were being done within the argument 
	list of the call to make_one_plot, which has fixed the problem for 
	the test data set in any case.

	Further testing carried out on both linux and solaris with other data 
	sets which verified that the task runs OK for this subset of datasets
 	too.
	

Version 2.2 - 2005-09-20 (NW)
----------------------------	

        Increased the y-scale range of the GTI plot following a request from 
	Leicester.  Previously the fracexp histogram plotted on the 
	same plot overlapped with the GTI points making it difficult to read.
	

Version 2.1 - 2005-02-21 (NW)
----------------------------	

        Changed the table from which the header information is read, back
	to the first extension (previous alterations having modified the
	selection of the original table).
	

Version 2.0 - 2005-01-28 (IMS/LUX, NW)
----------------------------	

	Elcplot now reads and plots the corrected source RA and DEC.
	Header spacings changed.  Made documentation updates with regards
	to all the changes made below.  Updated the test harness, again
	with regards to all the changes made below.

- Corrected a bug in which the time axis was always shown in seconds, regardless of the value of --units.
- FRACEXP axis label now gets plotted in same colour as data points (dark blue).
- Main header character height reduced to 0.9.

- Plot header printing now copes with negative MJD value.

- Fixed bugs in which (i) fracexp values were not being binned properly; (ii) null bkg values were being plotted as 0; (iii) funny plotting occurred when offsets were large. Number (iii) cannot be fully fixed in a simple fashion as part of the problem is pgplot's requirement for single-precision arguments.
- Made parameter --tscaleoffset mandatory.
- Added a warning to check --ounits when abs(tscaleoffset) > 10^5.
- Changed the functioning of the --offsetstyle=user behaviour back to the way it was before.
- Added a warning when the task decides to alter the value of --binsize.
- Some errors and warning calls had the task name instead of the error summary in the first field. This now fixed.
- Changed size of numeric labels from 0.9 to 0.7.

- Code rearrangement by IMS (& 1 extra parameter, --offsetstyle). cal has also been added to DEPEND. elcplot_ims may replace elcplot, this will be up to the task maintainer. Until this is decided, this package should NOT be uploaded into the official SAS.

	
Version 1.2.7 - 2004-09-10 (NW)
----------------------------

        Default is now usegtiset=no and useflareset=no.  Changed the
	aesthetics of the plot as well as added further information to the
	top of the plot (obs. ID, Exp. ID, Source no., original bin size).
	Fixed bug that existed when using the task on Solaris (x-axis data
	incorrectly plotted).  Also included a new parameter - forcestart
	- that the user may flag if they wish to plot the data set from
	the very beginning, regardless if the observation has started yet,
	and finish at the very end.  Further, the RA and dec are now
	written as HH:MM:SS.S and +/-DD:MM:SS.SS on the outplut plot.


Version 1.2.6 - 2004-09-03 (NW)
----------------------------

        Fixed a small bug that caused the program to take the wron
	Time_Vect value when there were a lot of NULL values in the file.

Version 1.2.5 - 2004-08-26 (NW)
----------------------------

	All data is now plotted (previously RATE == 0.0 and BACKV == 0.0
	were alllowed, but not ERROR == 0.0 and BACKE == 0.0 - all
	combinations are now always plotted).  The GTI and flare curves
	are now plotted in their entirety, nothing is deleted.  A small
	bug that did not allow the negative mean rate value to be plotted
	has now been rectified.

Version 1.2.4 - 2004-08-13 (NW)
----------------------------

	Changed small bug introduced when converting to the code to use
	time vector and also allows BACKV == 0.0 now too.

Version 1.2.3 - 2004-08-09 (NW)
----------------------------

	Made sure that ONLY the NULL values are taken out and not the 0.0
	values as well.  The time vector (instead of the row number) is
	used, as it is now provided in the input file.

Version 1.2.2 - 2004-08-02 (NW)
----------------------------

	Negative net count rates are now kept and the flare lightcurve is
	plotted as a line plot.  Elcplot is also able to accept an input
	that contains neither a GTI nor a flare file.  The documentation
	has been updated.

Version 1.2.1 - 2004-07-26 (NW)
----------------------------
    
	When all the data points were negative, elcplot finished with a
	fatal error, it now finishes with an error.  An error is now also
	given when when the user tries to run the program without a flare
	nor a gti set.  A warning is now raised when a non-background
	subtracted file is provided and the net count rate from the total
	source count rate and the background count rate is calculated and
	plotted.  The first and last data points are now plotted either
	one or two bin widths (depending on the size of the bins) from the
	plot frame and a small bug was rectified, which caused the wrong
	FRACEXP value top be plotted.  The full flare background is now
	plotted (and not the binned lightcurve), and the colour of the
	FRACEXP label now is the same as the plotted FRACEXP points.  The
	documentation of the task as duly been updated.

	
Version 1.2 - 2004-07-01 (NW)
	----------------------------

        There is now the option to plot the flare time series instead of
	the GTI series and the user can choose to use the DATE-OBS keyword
	for the offset time.  Some warnings have been modified and the
	documentation has been updated.

	
Version 1.1 - 2004-05-25 (NW)
----------------------------

        A few small changes to make sure that the binsize at the top of
	the plot is reported correctly, that all the GTIs are shown, that
	more significant figures are shown on the x-axis label display and
	to reduce the size of the points used in the timeseries and for
	the FRACEXP values.  The third panel showing GTIs and FRACEXP now
	shows two scales one on either side of the panel, the left axis is
	labelled 'GTI' and has two values marked '0' amd '1' and the right
	axis is labelled 'FRACEXP' and has values marked by with the
	original tickmarks.  The test and the dependencies have been
	modified so they pass the checks during the compilation of the
	SAS.  The documentation has also been updated.
	
Version 1.0 - 2004-05-19 (NW)
----------------------------

	Elcplot, a version of lcplot with no variability tests and a
	slightly modified output plot showing three windows, the net and
	background lightcurves as before and the GTI and Fractional
	Exposure values.

	
Version 0.1 - 2004-04-01
