	  constructor of CCfAccessLog. Modify operator<<() for
	  CcfAccessLog, so that it also re-issues warnings about expired
	  CCF constituents. This operator is used in taskmain before the
	  task is exited, so these warnings are again prominently shown. Is
	  this an example of a 'critical' warning? ;-)

	+ (Ccf.{cc,h}) Change the class CcfAccessLog so that it knows
	  about possible expired CCF constituents. In Ccf.cc rename the
	  FileLocator fileLocator to myfileLocator to avoid a name clash
	  with extern fileLocator (from SasFileLocator.h).  + Add the
	  configuration file ccf.conf to the config subdirectory.  + Write
	  test harness for the above: testccfconf
