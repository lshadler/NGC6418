ChangeLog for omgrismplot
===============================
Version 1.5.3 - 2011-02-21 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) 
	Reshaped to reduce the number of subroutine calls
	(as the previos fix of SSC-SPR-6649 did not work).
Version 1.5.2 - 2011-02-16 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) 
	String manipulation is modified in the subroutine 
	create_labels to avoid a crash in the 64-bit mode
	(SSC-SPR-6649)
Version 1.5.1 - 2009-11-25 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) A bug 
	related to the memory deallocation problem is fixed (SSC-SPR-6579)
Version 1.5 - 2009-04-06 (VNY) +(DEPEND) the previouse change was
	unmade and the dependency on ssclib-4.6 is included as
	the task uses one of the routines from this library.
Version 1.4 - 2009-04-05 (VNY) +(DEPEND) the dependency from ssclib
	is removed to avoid build failure.
Version 1.3 - 2008-05-01 (VNY) 	+(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) introducing
	the capability to generate a postscript file showing
	the spectra extraction regions on the grism rotated image
Version 1.2.1 - 2005-11-15, 2005-05-23 (VNY) 
	+(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) The X- and Y- 
	coordinates are introduced into the plot header; strange symbols
	at the top of the plot are eliminated (this version is
	not uploaded yet - VNY 15.11.2005)
Version 1.2 - 2005-10-18 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) A small bug
	introduced during the previous upload is fixed
Version 1.1 - 2005-10-18 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) A warning
	message is included in the case of no spectral data in the
	input file (fixed SSC-SPR-3526)
Version 1.0.6 - 2005-06-03 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90)
	A bug is fixed (SSC-SPR-3436) which was leading to the 
	task failure in the Full-Frame Low-Resolution mode when
	extracting field spectra. The failure was cause by some
	unexplicable manipulation of memory by the Fortran compiler:
	coding the same thing in slightly different way has fixed
	the problem.
Version 1.0.5 - 2004-10-02 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90)
	The contaminating sources are masked to avoid the 
	excessive scale of the plot in the vertical axis
	when some zero-order images overlap the 
	target spectrum (SPR-3396)
Version 1.0.4 - 2004-07-15 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) 
	The target plot is labelled with ``Object: target'' to 
	distinguish it from the other sources (SSC-SPR-3356)
Version 1.0.3 - 2004-05-13 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) Information
	bout the used spectrum extraction mode is inserted into
	the title of the output plot (SSC-SPR-3321)
Version 1.0.2 - 2004-03-04 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90)
	the bug causing crushing of the task on some data set
	is fixed (SSC-SPR-3267)
Version 1.0.1 - 2004-02-03 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90), 
	+(config/omgrismplot.par) The parameters plotflux and
	scalebkgplot are activeted. The spectra ID's are inserted
	into the plots (SSC-SPR-3242)
Version 1.0 - 2003-12-04 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) plotting
	of undetected spectra in included
Version 0.5 - 2003-11-21 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) wrong warning
	messages are corrected
Version 0.4 - 2003-11-20 (VNY) +(config/omgrismplot.par) the parameter
	plotdevise is set to the default value /PS since /VC is not 
	recognised in some machines
Version 0.3 - 2003-11-19 (VNY) +(config/omgrismplot.par) the parameter
	plotdevice is set to produce the portrait orientation 
	of the output plot by default; +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90):
	the plot labels are improved
Version 0.2 - 2003-11-07 (VNY) +(src/omgrismplot_mod.f90) a new parameter
	(plotflux) is introduced 
Version 0.1 - 2003-10-27 (VNY) Created as a new task for plotting 
	OM grism spectra, SAS-SCR-116
