constructs an OGIP-compliant table of Good
Time-Intervals (GTI) from a plain text description file.  A complex
fragmentation of the time-line may be described in terms of good and
bad intervals, which may be simple or periodic.  The description
elements are combined as the union of all the good intervals
intersected with the complement of the union of all the bad intervals.
In other words, a given point in time is good if it is covered by any
good intervals and not also covered by any bad intervals.  If no good
intervals are specified, a single good interval covering all time is
assumed; hence all times not covered by any bad intervals are
considered good.  The relative order of elements in the description
file is always irrelevant. (See
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#gtibuild:description:inputfiles">6</A> for a description of the
syntax of the description file.)

<P>
A periodic interval is a good or bad simple interval repeated through
a whole number of periods.  Because a periodic interval must be
translated into a sequence of explicit simple intervals, an open-ended
periodic interval would take infinite space to represent in the output
GTI table.  Therefore the number of periods must be finite.  The
syntax for describing a periodic interval is intended to be convenient
for the purpose of analyzing two-phase phenomena in the data.  The
starting and ending times are given, as with simple intervals, but the
ending time serves only to specify the final period, which may extend
beyond that point.  Each period is broken into two segments, one good
and the other bad.  This may be confusing because it sounds like a
periodic interval describes both good and bad intervals at the same
time; it does not.  A periodic good interval contains none of the bad
segments that are implicit in its definition.  Similarly a periodic
bad interval contains none of the good segments that are implicit in
its definition.  The periodic interval description syntax is simply a
convenient shorthand for a long list of simple intervals, regularly
spaced and all having the same length and type.

<P>
The periodic interval description designates whether the first segment
of each period is good or bad, and the second segment is then
implicitly the opposite.  Any periodic interval becomes its own
complement simply by switching this designation.  Regardless of which
segment is the good segment, the description also specifies whether it
is the set of good segments or the set of bad segments that comprise
the periodic interval; that is, whether it is a periodic good interval
or a periodic bad interval.  This choice must be made carefully based
on an understanding of how all the description elements are combined,
as explained above.  To avoid unexpected results, it is best not to
have simple good intervals along with a periodic good interval in the
same description file.  Having simple bad intervals together with a
periodic bad interval in the same description file does not create the
possibility of unexpected good time.  This is a foible of human
cognition, not an asymmetry in the description semantics.  If these
last two paragraphs have not made much sense yet, try again after
reading Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#gtibuild:description:inputfiles">6</A>, below.
