	+ New DssParser.h file (generated with bison 2.3)
	
Version 5.7.2 - 2013-11-11 (AI)
-----------	
	+ replaced 'unsigned long' types with 'uint32_t' to preserve bit flag 
	conversion between 32 and 64. At least, we found an error
	converting the bit flag '#XMMEA_SM' in 64bit platforms. 
	
Version 5.7.1 - 2012-03-29 (AI)
-----------	
	+ (DScomp.cc) Bug in block extension numbering fixed. SOC-SPR-6490

-------------
	+ Since the previous change did not work at all on Mac OS X, I am now checking
	  the option to remove any direct inclussion of Gti.h. Therefore, I did remove
	  #include <Gti.h> from DScomp.cc and DSgtiBlock.cc and keep it out as well in
	  DataSubspace.h. Such removal has passed successfully under Mac OS X and Linux.

Version 5.6.5 - 2010-02-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ Attempt to get rid of error message in Mac OS X about undefined symbol 
	  Gti::ETERNITY (defined in selectlib/src/utils/Gti.h), in libdss.dylib
	  due to flat_namespace: 
	  - Including explicitly #include <Gti.h> where needed:
	    * src/dsscore/DScomp.cc
	    * src/dsscore/DSgtiBlock.cc
	  - Removing #include <Gti.h> from src/dsscore/DataSubspace.h.

Version 5.6.4 - 2010-02-03 (EO)
-------------
	+ src/dsscore/Makefile: dss.h removed from INTERFACES to avoid creation of 
	  a fake soft link in $SAS_DIR/include when processed by Make.include.

Version 5.6.3 - 2009-07-06 (AI)
-------------	
	+ Modifications is several source files to make dal gcc 4.3 compliant.

	  at least one component. Closes SOC-SPR-2583

Version 5.5.2 - 2004-11-17 (AI)
-----------
	+ (DSgtiBlock.cc) Identical STDGTI extensions are now written to the 
	  final event file (SPR-2578). A warning message appears if two or more
	  STDGTI are identical.

Version 5.5.1 - 2004-08-20 (RDS/AI)
-----------
        + (src/DataSubspace.cc/h,          added new routine realextent so that 
           DScomp.cc, DSfilter.cc,         the extent of RA/DEC dss selections
           DSrange.cc, DSregionBlock.cc,   can be returned (SPR-2547)

ahead of param.

Version 5.3 - 2003-02-28 (GV/SOC)
-----------
	+ (DssLexer.cc,l,DssParser.cc,y) remove inclusion of values.h, add
	include <cfloat>. This makes it compile on Mac OS X.
	
Version 5.2 - 2003-01-30 (DH)
-----------
	+ Package now tracks range filters which can never select anything, and does 
	  not propogate or write out dss components containing such filters.  Closes
	  SSC-SPR-3014.
	+ Range filters of TIME now get converted (at least in most cases) to GTI 
	  filters, which should be subsequently merged with the other TIME GTI filters.

Version 5.1 - 2003-01-21 (DH)
-----------
	+ Fix bug in test harness which was still referencing the old style include
	  file.

Version 5.0 - 2003-01-07 (DH)
-----------
	+ Change version number to reflect fact that 4.0 was delivered without the
	  changes to the bit mask format.

Version 4.1 - 2002-09-30 (DH)
-----------
	+ Change directory name src/dssbuild src/build.
	+ Get rid of dss.h in favor of DataSubspace.h. Maintaining two

	  specify only the region file.  Closes SSC-SPR-2929.
	+ Fix bug in the operator&() method of the Range class, which 
	  was not properly considering Unbounded ranges in some cases.
	  Also properly adjust max value for Ranges when changing types.
	  Closes SSC-SPR-2954.
	
Version 3.17 - 2002-07-23 (GV/SOC)
------------
	+ Re-upload of 3.16.8 in the development track.

	  into a Box.

Version 3.16.2 - 2002-01-28 (DH)
--------------
	+ Fix bug in 3.16.1 with writing of selection expressions for 
	  box functions.  Also modify the extent() method so it returns
	  sensible values for the box function as well.

Version 3.16.1 - 2002-01-28 (DH)
--------------
	+ Bug fix for box functions in dss parser was not complete.  Now makes
	  adjustment for full width to half width when writing out a selection
	  expression as well.

Version 3.16 - 2002-01-18 (DH)
------------
	+ Fix bug in the explicit copy of DSregionFilter objects.  Rotated shapes
	  were not being recognized as such in the copy process.
	+ Replace <climits> with <cfloat> in Range.cc as the preferred place to obtain
	  the DBL_MAX macro.  This should work on linux.
	+ Write MTYPE and MFORM keywords to event files specfying the components of
	  2-d filters used in the dss.
	+ Modify cleanDss funtion so that it takes into account ranges with a value of 
	  [Inf] in an efficient way.

Version 3.15 - 2002-01-18 (DH)
------------
	+ Change DSblockFilter class so that in only opens the associated block when
	  really necessary by storing the block name and the parent name in the class.
	  Greatly reduces the number of times the block has to be opened (in one test,
	  from over 300 to 15).
	+ Fix bug in dss parser which was not passing the proper argument values to
	  the box and rectangle functions.

Version 3.14 - 2001-11-21 (DH)
------------
	+ Generate unique block names for new gti extensions when combining gti's in
	  DScomp::compressRegions().  Gets rid of some annoying warning messages.
	+ DScomp::compressRegions() now compresses range filters, as well as gti
	  and region filters.  Implement & operator for range lists inorder to
	  facilitate this.
	+ Real ranges are now written to keywords and in selection expressions in
	  exponetial format.

Version 3.13 - 2001-10-16 (DH)
------------
	+ Change dss parser so that it will except 'true' in filtering expressions.
	  A DSS component with no filters is considered to be 'true'.  Also modify 
	  the writing of data subspace info in DataSubspace.cc to deal with this.
	+ Fix geoExtent function, which in some cases was not making a box big enough
	  to contain some rotated shapes.
        + Update documentation for the extent method, to try and make the description
          more clear.
	
Version 3.12 - 2001-10-11 (DH)
------------
        + Fix f90 test harness, which had been replaced with a temporary file
	  (which had a bug!).  Sorry, Giuseppe.
	
Version 3.11 - 2001-09-24 (DH)
------------
	+ Changed all standard containers to use the explicit std:: scope operator.
	+ Fix initialization bug in DScomp.cc which was upsetting the optimizer.
	
Version 3.10 - 2001-09-19 (DH)
-----------
	+ Add new hasFilter method to the DataSubspace class.
	+ Add clear() method to the DssBuilder class, to delete dss objects
	  and free memory.  Called at the end of the getDss method.
	+ Add contains() method to the Range class.

Version 3.9 - 2001-09-03 (DH)
-----------
	+ Implement negation of DataSuspaces. The '!' operator works for the
	  DataSubspace class, and is implemented for all filter types except
	  bit masks and region masks.
	+ Add support for logical not to the dss parser and builder.  Logical
	  not's should no longer need to be propogated thru an expression by
	  hand.  Closes SCR-50.
	+ Add include statement for cstdio to DScomp.cc .
	
Version 3.8 - 2001-08-13 (DH)
-----------
	+ Change system and compiler include statements to conform to standard.
	+ Dss parser now handles the '+' and '[]' conventions for specifying fits
	  file extensions.  Closes SSC-SPR-2082.
	+ Make the DSfilter::region() method work with region block filters.  Using
	  this functionality, modify DScomp::compressRegions() method to work with
	  block filters.  Closes SCR 51.
	+ Add attribute to the DataSubspace class which indicates whether an error
	  occurred when building the dss from the parser.  Closes SSC-SPR-2029.
	+ Trap case where data subspace is so large its indexes exceed fits keyword
	  name size.  Issue a warning message.
	+ Rationalize code for renaming blocks with duplicate names.
	+ Modify DScomp::compressRegions() so that it will combine GTIs as well as
	  regions.
	
Version 3.7 - 2001-08-06 (DH)
-----------
	+ Include values.h in DssParser and DssLexer.  May fix some compile
	  problems on Debian linux.
	+ Fix SSC-SPR-2465, which is basically a follow on from SSC-SPR-2023.
	+ Fix SSC-SPR-2388 and (probably) SSC-SPR-2190.  Datasubspace info was
	  not getting properly deleted from a Block.

Version 3.6.1 - 2001-05-25 (DH)
-------------
	+ Fix SSC-SPR-2023.  If the dss writer finds a block name clash, it now renames
	  the new block to something else.

Version 3.6 - 2001-04-19 (DH)
-----------
	+ Add new DataSubspace and DScomp method, called compressRegions.
	  Tries to combine GeoRegions from the filters in a component into
	  fewer filters.
	+ Parser no longer tries to distinguish different axes and combine expressions
	  for region filters in a component.  This was just causing headaches.  Instead
	  regions are combined after parsing using the new compressRegions method.  This
	  closes SSC-SPR-2266.

Version 3.5 - 2000-12-22 (UL)
-----------
	+ a couple of trivial changes to make the optimizer happy
	
Version 3.4.3 - 2000-11-14 (DH)
-------------
	+ Fix SSC-SPR-2071, Cannot negate region in paratheses.
	
Version 3.4.2 - 2000-10-31 (DH)
-------------
	+ Add info file.

Version 3.4.1 - 2000-10-12 (DH)
-------------
	+ Parser now excepts parentheses around axis names.  Closes SSC-SPR-1949.
	+ Parser now excepts numbers of the form 1E2, as well as 1.E2.
	+ Change to new convention for representing octal numbers (now 
	  preceded by an 'o').
	+ Accept real-valued ranges for integer-valued columns. Reals are truncated
 	  to integers, with a warning message.
	+ Change software for detecting block filter types to be more robust,
	  with a clearer error message in case of failure.
	
Version 3.4 - 2000-10-02 (DH)
-----------
	+ Error catching for the parser now done in DssBuilder:getDss method.

Version 3.3 - 2000-09-25 (DH)
-----------
	+ Fix bug in Range::maxRange method which was causing crashes on DEC.  Could
	  also be have been causing some of the 'out of memory' problems.

Version 3.2 - 2000-07-27 (DH)
-----------
	+ Add missing '#include <cstdio>' to DSregion.cc

Version 3.1 - 2000-07-19 (DH)
-----------
	+ Incorporates changes up to version 3.0.6 .
	+ Change projection of axes in selectExpression, so that if both the components
	  of a 2D axis are listed, then the axis is included in the expression.
 	+ Add method 'extent' to the DataSubspace, DScomp, and DSfilter methods.  Update
	  documentation to correspond.
	+ Implement volume calculation for Region and RegionBlock type filters.
	+ Add support in parser for mask filters which do not use the 'in' operator.
	  Closes SPR 1916.
	
Version 3.0.6 - 2000-06-29 (DH)

Version 3.0.2 - 2000-06-15 (DH)
-------------
	+ Enhanced error message for DSS parsing, in response to evselect SPR 1775.
	+ Prevent checking of unitialized values in Range objects.  Closes evselect
	  SPR 1778.
	+ Increase accuracy of ranges stored in keywords to 15 digits.  Store integer
	  valued ranges as integer 32 instead of interger 16.  Closes evselect SPR
	  1814.

	  required for selectlib (closes evselect SPR 1637).
	+ Adjust DSS to account for the change in sense of bit mask filters (this
	  change is not backward compatible).
	+ Add code in parser to give 2d region filters reasonable names, based on
	  the value of their components.

Version 2.8 - 2000-03-08 (DH)
-----------
	+ selectExpression() method was producing range specifictions which could
	  not be parsed by selectlib. Fixed.

Version 2.7 - 2000-02-29 (DH)
-----------
