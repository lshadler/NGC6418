Change log for emframes
=======================

Open SPRs:
----------
	None.

Version 5.10 - 2016-09-06 (AI)
-------------
- (src/emframes_mod.f90) Initialization to null of all pointers that are passed 
  to C++ (Dope vectors). If we do not initizialize the pointers, 
  we get seg fault at run-time with gcc-6.2.	

Version 5.9 - 2016-07-18 (AI)
-------------
	+ (src/emframes_mod.f90) gfortran compatibility change applied.

Version 5.8.1 - 2010-03-10 (JB)
-------------
- Fix SPR 6600: problem with OBSID 0611180101 which occurred in timing mode
  when most frames were lost to counting mode.

Version 5.8 - 2007-11-26 (JB)
-----------
- Fix problem with OBSID 0510010701 which occurred when the frame renumbering
  resulted in fewer frames than initially, or when the very last frame
  was corrupted.

Version 5.7 - 2007-01-11 (BFM)
-----------
- Makes use of the counting mode data for frame renumbering.

Version 5.6 - 2006-01-20 (BFM)
-----------
- Missing deallocation of arrays, resulting in error in low memory mode.

Version 5.5 - 2006-01-04 (BFM)
-----------
- Slight improvement of the timing accuracy (0.2 ms at most) by correcting
  for the difference between the standard FTFINE unit (40 us) used in
  OAL_frameCounterToObt and the better one (39.99 us) used in emframes.

Version 5.4 - 2005-11-15 (BFM)
-----------
- Implemented a sort procedure in FRAMES before data handling to deal
  with files containing repeated or out of order frame IDs. The list of
  frame IDs is scanned first, and only a subset of the sequence is sorted.
  A permutation array is created to access the frames in order of increasing
  frame ID.  This preserves data and events in good frames that were
  previously rejected because they appeared out of the normal sequence.
- Divided main loop in FRAMES into three loops to improve legibility
  of code and remove some of the intermediate arrays. The first loop
  scans through all frames and flags problems in the frame numbering
  and time sequence.  The second loop deals with telemetry drops and
  event cleaning.  The third (very small) loop writes data to the output 
  arrays, skipping over bad frames.
- Added three flags: flag_badfid (64) and flag_mulfid (16) are used 
  to identify rejected and retained frames repectively in a sequence
  of duplicated frame numbers. flag_t_dec (16384) is used instead of 
  flag_t_wrong (2048, formerly named flag_time) to identify frames 
  where the time tag decreased. flag_t_wrong is now used only in cases 
  where the time tag was negative or jumped in a fashion incompatible 
  with extended frames or telemetry drops.
- removed some of the intermediate allocatable arrays.
