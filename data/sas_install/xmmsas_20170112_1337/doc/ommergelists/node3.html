Description
</H1>
This program has originated due to the new <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OM</SPAN>
functionality of source-detection on mosaiced sky-images. 
It matches the sources from the first input observation source-list file (ie 
those detected from the individual exposure images) with those from
the second input observation source-list file (ie those that have been 
detected on the mosaiced sky-image), and propogates these matches into an output source-list
with the following caveats:

<OL>
<LI>Any <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">unmatched</SPAN> sources from the second-list having a raw count-rate (including 
the background) 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\leq$"></SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">maxrawrate</SPAN> value are added to the output observation 
source-list file. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Often fields are imaged through more than one filter. An object exists in a source-list if it is
detected through a minimum of one filter. Non-detections of the known source through other filters are not
flagged. However, if the second source-list is constructed using, for example, a deeper mosaicked image then
it can potentially contain new detections of a known source which has already been found in the shallow images
of individual exposures, through different filters. Provided new detections in list 2 of known sources already
found in other wavebands in list 1 have intrinsic + background count-rates <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\leq$"></SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">maxrawrate</SPAN> then they are
propogated into the new combined source-list. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Deeper exposures provide a more significant detection and better constrained source properties. If there
is a source match between the two lists through a specific filter, the properties of the most significant detection
are adopted within the output list. An exception to this rule occurs if a source with intrinsic + background count-rate

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$&gt;$"></SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">maxrawrate</SPAN>. In these bright-source cases the properties derived or combined from individual images are adopted
within the output list. This exception prevents systematic errors related to combining different CCD dead-times. frame-rates
and coincidence-losses from propogating into the bright-source sample. 

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">maxrawrate</SPAN> value is an optional input parameter, with a default value of 5 counts/sec; below this threshold 
a coincidence-loss correction to photon rates is not required within photometric conversions. The reason why there is a maximum 
raw-rate cut-off is due to the way <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">OM</SPAN> photometry is conducted. A
coincidence loss correction is applied to the count-rates
and this correction depends on the frame-time and dead-time fraction. These CCD properties vary from exposure to exposure and
so coincidence-losses cannot be corrected in mosaicked images with the current SAS algorithms. By propogating only the faint sources
from the second list into the output table we avoid systematic bright-source photometry error, while retaining the full potential size of the
source sample within the output.

<P>
Since this cut-off is
determined by the input parameter <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">maxrawrate</SPAN>, the
user has complete control over what sources are retained. It should be noted
that for the photometry of the sources detected on the mosaiced sky-images, no
coincidence-loss correction will have been applied and the dead-fraction correction
will have been incorporated into the exposure images. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Ommergelists</SPAN> will compare the celestial coordinates of the matched sources from both
source-lists and compute mean <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">RA</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Dec</SPAN> offsets and add them to the
coordinates of the second source-list to correct for any small differences in their origins
(it will give a warning about any significant offsets indicating bad astrometry).

<P>
The program can also produce graphs comparing various properties of the common sources in the two
lists, which can be a useful check for possible problems. It can also
produce a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ds9</SPAN> region file that allows the new sources detected on the mosaiced
sky images to be easily identified.

<P>
