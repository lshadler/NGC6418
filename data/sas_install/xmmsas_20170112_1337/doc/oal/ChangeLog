					 TIMDEL for checking for time jumps.
					 This still may be overridden by the
					 user with the SAS_JUMP_THRESHOLD
					 environment variable

Version 3.115 - 2006-06-01 (RDS)
---------------
		+ src/AuxHKaccess.cc  -  the JUMP THRESHOLD code set 
                                 back to original version unless
                                 user defines the SAS_JUMP_THRESHOLD
                                 environment variable

        + src/AttitudeLocator.cc -  A delta of 0.75s is subtracted from
                                 the times in the RAF file to 
                                 compensate for the star-tracker CCD
                                 integration time (SPR-2669)

Version 3.114.2 - 2006-01-10 (RDS)
---------------
		+ f90/OalF90cxxGlue.cc/h - added routines to access IPPV values
          f90/oal.f90              which are observation rather than 
          f90test/oaltest.f90      exposure specific (OAL_hasconfIPPV and
          odf/0010_PPPPPPOOLL_SCX00000SUM.SAS       
                                   OAL_getconfIPPV<type>). A new test harness

                                   with the wrong expanded
                                   filename being returned for ODFs containing
                                   a scheduled and unscheduled exposure with
                                   the same number
                                                                                
Version 3.114.1 - 2005-12-02 (RDS)

                                   filename being returned for ODFs containing
                                   a scheduled and unscheduled exposure with
                                   the same number

Version 3.114 - 2005-06-08 (JSH)

Version 3.113.1 - 2005-02-21 (RDS)
---------------
        copy of 3.113 for the release track

Version 3.113 - 2004-12-21 (RDS)
---------------
                + src/AttitudeLocator.cc     -  removed problem when attitude
                                        interpolation occurs with points
                                        crossing the 360.0 - 0.0 RA
                                        boundary (SPR-2589)

Version 3.112 - 2004-12-16 (RDS)
---------------
		+ src/AttitudeLocator.cc -  added code to allow the gap between
		data and attitude records to be 20 times longer for 
		slew observations.

Version 3.111.6 - 2004-07-27 (JSH)
---------------
		+ Time Correlation processing for SAS 6.0.5 defaults to TCS
		+ Fix problem determining obs boundaries for TCX records
		for in case of multiple exposures present for instrument being
		processed
		

Version 3.111.5 - 2004-07-27 (JSH)
---------------
        + Change TimeCorrelator constructors to avoid calling
	other constructors as default parameters. gcc 2.9x doesn't
	like that at all.

Version 3.111.4 - 2004-07-20 (JSH)
---------------
	+ Update OAL to process TCX data files
		- New environment variables used by OAL
		- OalServer uses environment variable to 
		select TCS or TCX (a la ahf/raf handling)
		- OalServer then calls TimeCorrelator with
		appropriate arguments
		- TimeCorrelator updated to process TCX data
		- C++ test case updated
		- Documentation updated :)

Version 3.111.3 - 2004-06-29 (RDS)
---------------
	+ Addition of HBR_OFFSET_DATA type and logic to return the
      best offset map for a given exposure
      src/Odf.cc/h

Version 3.111.2 - 2004-02-13 (UL - still around :)
---------------
	+ more changes to pn AUX data anomaly detection/correction logic to
	  cope with seen problems in a number of ODFs (see email MJF to
	  MK/UL dated 2004-01-29):
		- relax maximum allowed fractional frame time jitter to better
		  cope with extended counting mode intervals
		- for jumps that are not +/-1s _always_ look for jumps in the opposite
		  direction within the next 50 frames even if an integer offset
		  was found that satisfies the 'delta criterion' (=delta must be
		  integer multiple of nominal frame time); it used to be that
		  this check was supressed if a suitable offset was found leading to
		  the introduction of bogus corrections (e.g. Crab ODFs
		  0411_0153750[2345]01)
		- if delta<0: only accept offsets that are odd and that correct jumps
					  occuring close to the end of a second (FTFINE>40000)
		- if delta>0: only accept offsets that are +/-1s or larger than
					  80% of the gap size
		- all other found deltas will not lead to a correction now but just
		  appear as 'unidentified deltas' in the log

Version 3.111.1 - 2003-12-12 (RDS)
-------------
    + removed f90 interface to RGS diagnostic maps. 
    + removed call to hasRgsDiagnosticMap - can use hasSet() instead.

Version 3.111 - 2003-12-11 (RDS)
-------------
    + finished SCR-133.

Version 3.110 - 2003-12-05 (EO)
-------------
	+ oal_description.tex typo corrected.

Version 3.109 - 2003-12-04 (RDS)
-------------
	+ added the routine OAL_RGSDiagImage to return a diagnostic image
      for an RGS configuration (SCR-133)

Version 3.108 - 2003-08-06 (UL)
-------------
	+ more changes to the PN-AUX data anomaly detection/correction logic:
		* for negative jumps limit the search interval for an offset
		  that makes the difference between consecutive frames an
		  integer multiple of the frame time to [|i|, |i|+2] (was
		  [|i|, |i|+10]); i is value of jump (fixed problem in
		  0156_0095810401_PNS00300AUX CCD7 reported by MJF)
		* supress verification of very large gap size; e.g. in
		  0362_0124930301_PNS02500AUX.FIT CCD4 there is gap of >177s
		  corresponding to >30000 missing frames (Burst mode); the frame
		  time jitter makes it senseless to verify the gap size
		* detection of 'premature increments' improved; 
		  0362_0124930301_PNS02500AUX.FIT CCD4 contains a case where old
		  logic failed
	+ fixed very minor problem with output message

Version 3.107 - 2003-07-03 (UL)
-------------
	+ pn AUX data anomaly detection+correction logic: there can be blocks
	  of AUX data whose QUADRANT/CCDID signature is wrong, e.g. they seemingly
	  stem from different quadrants (see doc comments in src/AusHKaccess.cc
	  for more info) - the size of these blocks was limited to 25 rows but
	  0137_0128120401_PNS00200AUX.FIT (source PSR1507) contains an example
	  of a 31-row block; the allowed size has not been increased to 50 rows

Version 3.106 - 2003-06-27 (UL)
-------------
	+ Calculation of signal propagation delay at SAS_OBT_MET_FIT=1,...:
	  Modified code after confirmation (email Ramon Munoz dated 2003-06-27)
	  that onboard delays have to be SUBTRACTED instead of added

Version 3.105 - 2003-06-20 (UL)
-------------
	+ pn auxiliary data processing: fixed a minor problem in a code branch
	  that deals with the very rare occurence of apparent CDMU crashes
	  during an exposure - in this case the determination of pn clock reset
	  times was incorrect (caused problem with 0104_0111130201_PNS00300AUX)

Version 3.104 - 2003-06-18 (UL)
-------------
	+ Implemented SCR 115: oal should not use unprocessed raw attitude file
      by introduction of new (optional) enviroment variable SAS_ATTITUDE;
	  if not set default is to use AHF data; doc updated accordingly

Version 3.103 - 2003-06-16 (GV)
-------------
	+ Misc. fixes to make gcc-3.3 happy: include <cassert> and/or
	  proper initialization of base classes.

Version 3.102 - 2003-05-02 (UL)
-------------
	+ bug fix to solve (rare) problem with S/U exposure confusion (seen
	  in e.g. 0591_0144900101 - unscheduled Timing exposure follows
	  scheduled Imaging exposure with same exposure number; S/U002)

Version 3.101 - 2003-04-04 (UL)
-------------
	+ fixed minor problem with new InstrumentalTimer() I/F

Version 3.100 - 2003-04-03 (UL)
-------------
	+ added OalServer::instrumentalTimer()

Version 3.99 - 2003-03-18 (UL)
------------
	+ closed SPR 2418: class IPPV should not be public string

Version 3.98.2 - 2003-03-12 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed problem with repeated OdfInfo::server.odf() invocations generating
	  new instances of OdfInfo::Odf() objects

Version 3.98.1 - 2003-02-12 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed minor bug that would cause an 'unidentified delta' in the pn AUX
	  data anomaly recognition stage to get reported when there is none;
	  occurs when wrong-quad entries are present within a period after
	  a FTCOARSE jumps and before a reset [e.g. 0149_0111100301]

Version 3.98 - 2003-02-07 (UL)
------------
	+ implemented piecewise-linear interpolation of time correlation data as
	  alternative method to global polynomial fit; switched on by setting
	  second field 'degree' in SAS_OBT_MET_FIT to negative values; doc
	  updated accordingly

Version 3.97 - 2003-01-30 (UL)
------------
	+ small improvement in pn AUX anomaly detection logic related to find
	  blocks of wrong-quadrant/CCD data

Version 3.96 - 2003-01-30 (UL)
------------
	+ skip pn AUX data anomaly correction stage if data is found too anomalous
	  (e.g. old-vintage SciSim AUX data)
	+ catch pathological case that frame time increment is 0 (caused crash
	  in epframes test harness)

Version 3.95 - 2003-01-29 (UL)
------------
	+ much improved pn AUX data anomaly detection and correction algorithm;
	  should now be able to reliably find all FTCOARSE counter jumps
	  [Note: Access to EPN_TIMECORR CCF for AUX data anomaly processing
	   needed]
	+ couple of new warning messages about pn AUX anomalies (e.g.
	  unidentified deltas)

Version 3.94 - 2002-09-11 (JBa)
--------
	+ some ANSI C++ compliance fixes (in preparation of moving to gcc>=3.1)

Version 3.93 - 2002-07-02 (JBa)
------------
	+ replaced all occurences of 'strstream' with standard-conformant
	  'stringstream'

Version 3.93 - 2002-07-02 (JBa)
------------
	+ Using sstream instead of strstream

Version 3.92 - 2002-06-20 (UL)
------------
	+ hasAssociatedSet()/associatedSet() now works for PN DLI data
	  (association is made by searching for CCD number match in
	  DLI exposures not later than 15mins after science exposure)
	+ internal code change to work around out-of-mem compiler problem
	  at -O2 on Tru64

Version 3.91.8 - 2002-05-28 (UL)
--------------
	+ changed text of new error message introduced with 3.91.7

	+ issue error message if used with skeleton summary file (odfingest
	  has not been run)

Version 3.91.6 - 2002-05-03 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed rare problem with highly anomalous pn aux data (extremely
	  frequent occurence of FTCOARSE=32767 frames, seen in e.g.
	  odffix'ed 0053_0121500601)

Version 3.91.5 - 2002-04-26 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed minor problem with pathological exposures shorter than 90s
	+ fixed minor problem with rare anomaly in pn PMH data (seen e.g.
	  in 0175_0132520301_PNX00000PMH.FIT)

Version 3.91.4 - 2002-04-23 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed new problem seen with ODF 0120_0102640201 (this is related
	  to a 3.91-change to correct for TM anomaly in Crab ODF 0411_0153750301)

Version 3.91.3 - 2002-04-19 (UL)
--------------
	+ end with error if orbit file is empty

--------------
	+ another improvement in enhancing robustness against EPIC clock
	  late-reset anomalies

Version 3.91.1 - 2002-04-18 (UL)
--------------
	+ small fix in orbit file reading: better robustness againt pathological
	  empty orbit files (e.g. odffixed data)

Version 3.91 - 2002-04-17 (UL)
------------
	+ meliorated robustness against EPIC clock late-reset anomaly
	  (this fixes problem seen in Crab obs 0411_0153750301)
	+ fixed another problem with S/U exposure confusion (e.g. in ODF
	  0418_0110980301)
	+ fixed minor problem with re-calculation of signal propagation delays
	+ read entire orbit file instead of just data covering obs window; needed
	  for recalculation of signal propagation delays in TimeCorrelator

Version 3.90.2 - 2002-04-11 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed minor problem with determination of ODF location when SAS_ODF is
	  given just name of summary file

Version 3.90.1 - 2002-04-02 (UL)
--------------
	+ fixed another problem related to treatment of data blocks with
	  incorrect QUADRANT/CCDIDs in EPN auxiliary data [lead to negative
	  GTIs generated by epframes with at least ODF 0078_0124100101]

Version 3.90 - 2002-03-25 (UL)
------------
	+ introduced fifth SAS_OBT_MET_FIT field: 0/1 toggle switch controlling
	  whether or not GS handovers in the TC data are ignored (1) or not (0);
	  in the latter case all TC data after a handover are not taken into
	  account; default is 1, i.e. all TC data are considered
	+ updated doc w.r.t to new SAS_OBT_MET_FIT control parameter

Version 3.89.1 - 2002-03-25 (UL)
--------------
	+ changed default parameters controlling OBT-MET FIT from 0,1,1.e-2,.9
	  to 0,4,5.e-5,.9

	  test harness to fail)

Version 3.88.9 - 2002-03-08 (UL)
--------------
	+ make OAL_setState(set) robust against missing FILENAME attribute in set
	+ fixed minor problem with treatment of very last frame in frame-counter
	  to OBT conversion for pn (problem occures in ODF 0093_0124710201)

Version 3.88.8 - 2002-03-04 (UL)
--------------
	+ adjustment of internal parameter in pn frame-counter to OBT conversion

--------------
	+ brought in line with caloalutils-1.64

Version 3.88.3 - 2002-02-06 (UL)

		   OAL_setState comes now on three flavors: accepting list of
		   state variables, data set name, reference to block; initial
		   implementation of latter two is through dissection of the file
		   name for setting the state variables

Version 3.9 - 1999-03-19 (UL)

Version 3.2 - 1999-02-22 (UL)
-----------
	+ f90/oal.f90: removed '...length' fields from ExposureInfoType as
	  this can be calculated with new CalOalUtility::toTimeTag
	+ updated test harness

Version 3.1 - 1999-02-17 (UL)
-----------
	+ f90test/oaltest.f90: fixed expected value of psi in toEulerAngles-test

Version 3.0 - 1999-02-10 (UL)
-----------
	+ environment variable ODF_DIR no longer recognized

Version 2.12 - 1999-02-09 (UL)
------------
	+ renaming of environment variable ODF_DIR -> SAS_ODFDIR
	+ updated documentation (new routine OAL_toEulerAngles, generic task
	  command line parameter --odfdir in taskmain >=v1.16)

Version 2.11 - 1999-02-04 (UL)
------------
	+ environment variable 'ODF_DIR' is now 'SAS_ODFDIR'
	+ SPR fixes:
		o 460: Too cryptic error messages
		  [have been made more lucid with more parameters being written out]
		o 477: OAL error message written
		  [OAL has been made more robust - should no longer core dump
		   without any message]
		o 569: Assertion in ODFs with more than one exposure
		  [test OAL with more than one exposure in oal/odf - worked ok]

Version 2.10 - 1999-02-03 (UL)
------------
	+ code overhaul; now there is a single global instance of an
	  OalServer object
	+ all attitude related processing uses now the notion of 'astronomical
	  position angle' as opposed to 'position angle' defined by FD
	+ bug fix: GO data from ODF summary file was incompletely read
	+ OAL can be build as shared library
	+ a couple of new OalUtils methods
	+ works now with scisimsimpleodf

Version 2.9 - 1999-01-29 (UL)
-----------
	+ fixes to make the Oal compile under egcs 1.1.1
	
Version 2.8 - 1999-01-27 (UL)
-----------
	+ fixes to make the Oal compile under gcc 2.8.1

Version 2.7 - 1998-11-20 (UL)
-----------
	+ bug fix in Odf-class method (caused epframes to crash)

Version 2.6 - 1998-11-19 (UL)
-----------
	+ more fixes pertaining to ODF ICD 1.0 -> 2.0 change

Version 2.5 - 1998-11-13 (UL)
-----------
	+ new build procedure in-line with what is done in the Dal: separate
	  libaries are build in each src-subdir which get combined in a
	  new directory 'interface'; this also contains now all needed symbolic
	  links to *.h/*.f90/*.mod

Version 2.4 - 1998-11-12 (UL)
-----------
	+ new sym-link src/oal.f90->../f90/oal.f90 (relates to SPRs 273/274)

Version 2.3 - 1998-10-14
-----------
    + changed ODF summary file in sample ODF (ODF ICD 2.0: there are now
      only 6 INSTRUMENT blocks - ERM was dropped)
    + frameCounterToObt() methods more robust
	+ two new fields in	`ExposureInfoType': scheduledExposureTime/
      actualExposureTime (F90 API)
	+ new field 'isSlew' in	`OdfInfoType' (F90 API)
	+ fixed SPR 424: Need to know filter used during exposure
	  (new inquiry routine 'OAL_activeFilter()')

Version 2.2 - 1998-10-05
-----------
	+ added missing include (iomanip.h) (MB)

Version 2.1 - 1998-09-29 (UL)
-----------
	+ fixed SPR 417: Problems with frameToTime conversion for EPIC PN
	+ fixed SPR 420: Extra info. needed from ODF summary file

Version 2.0 - 1998-08-30 (UL)
-----------
    + generally overhauled and extended; there is now a proper implementation
      behind every announced routine in the F90 API; new classes:
		o TimeCorrelator  for OBT->UTC, ERT->UTC conversions
		o AttitudeLocator for determination of spacecraft attitude at
          any point during the observation
        o PositionLocator for determination of spacecraft position and
          velocity at any point in time during the observation
        o FrameCounterVector/ObtVector + support classes to perform
		  the conversion from CCD frame counters to COBT values to
          proper event time tags
        o support classes for the above

    + a couple of non-backwards compatible changes in the F90 API (therefore
      the 1.4->2.0 transition):
        o dropped state variables 'status'/verbosity'/'observationStartDate'
          status    : no need for it any more - OAL uses now general SAS error
                      handling strategy ('if-error-boom')
          verbosity : is now controlled by the environment (VERBOSITY)
          observationStartDate: not needed
        o added new state variables 'ccdNr'/'nodeNr'/'attitudefromAhf'
          ccdNr/nodeNr   : the chip/node id
          attitudeFromAhf: boolean switch determining whether attitude data
                           are to come from the AHF or from OM tracking
                           history frames
        o dropped 'OAL_error' routine
        o renamed 'OAL_selectType' -> 'OAL_selectScope'
        o new auxiliary function 'OAL_toAttitudeMatrix' to convert a
          attitude record as returned by 'OAL_getAttitude' into a matrix
          representation
        o new enquiry function 'OAL_exposureInfo'
        o 'directoryName' fields added to structure returned by 'OAL_odfInfo'

    + a couple of tools in the sample ODF directory 'odf' which generate a
      dummy Attitude History File, and embryonic EMOS1 periodic HK and
      auxiliary files for EMOS1 exposure #1; all are needed for the test
	  harnesses

    + re-organization of directory structure:
         odf    : dummy ODF for test harness and example task
         src    : all C++ sources
         cxxtest: tests of C++ implementation
         f90    : F90 API, C++/F90 I/F
         f90test: tests of F90 layer
         doc    : documentation

    + test harnesses: extentended to test new functionality (from C++ and
      F90);

    + OAL example task: moved to f90test and extended to demonstrate usage
      of new features

    + documentation updated to be in line with code changes	

    + remaining issues:
        o construction of PositionLocator class from data in Reconstructed
          Orbit File (ROF) is still dummy - need more information on
          structure of ROF before a proper implementation can commence
        o construction of AttitudeLocator from OM tacking history data
          is not implemented yet - algorithms needs to be clarified and
          meaning of OM telemetry to be confirmed (e.g. roll angle)

Version 1.4 - 1998-07-20 (UL)
-----------
    + depends on utils 1.8 now

Version 1.3 - 1998-07-07 (UL)
-----------
    + test harness of StringPool class moved to Cal
    + fixed SOC-SPRs:
          o 326: Update documentation
          o 327: Add oal.tex closely following the template
          o 328: Merge v1status.txt and status.txt into description
          o 329: Remove spurious files (src/OalAtoms.cc.new,src/OalAtoms.h.new)
    + doc/oal.tex removed - this is now created on-the-fly by 'make ps/html'

Version 1.2 - 1998-06-08 (UL)
-----------
    + new function OAL_expandFileName()

Version 1.1 - 1998-06-03 (UL)
-----------
    + fixed SOC-SPR 244 (broken html links in doc)

Version 1.0 - 1998-05-14 (UL)
-----------
    + Initial version for SAS v1 integration
