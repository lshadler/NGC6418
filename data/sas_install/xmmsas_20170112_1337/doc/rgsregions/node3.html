<P>
<A NAME="526"></A><A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="../rgsregions/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsregions</SPAN></A>
defines and constructs the various RGS
 event-selection regions, and adds them to the source list (see
 <A NAME="530"></A><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="../rgssources/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgssources</SPAN></A>).  Event-selection regions are closed

two-dimensional shapes that may be used to filter the event list for
 the purpose of spectral analysis (see <A NAME="534"></A><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="../rgsspectrum/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsspectrum</SPAN></A>).  The

regions are stored as extension tables in the source list, formatted
 according to the specifications of the ``ASC FITS File Designers'
 Guide''.  Image regions and the spatial background region refer to
 the plane of dispersion versus cross-dispersion (<EM>image plane</EM>)
 and select events based on their spatial coordinates.  An image
 region selects events from a specific astrophysical source, while the
 spatial background region selects events that are presumed consistent
 with the lack of any particular source.  The order regions refer to
 the plane of dispersion versus calibrated pulse-height (<EM>energy
 plane</EM>) and select events from a specific astrophysical source within
 a particular reflection order.  The order regions exploit the
 over-determined nature of coordinates in the energy plane to greatly
 reduce spurious detections. For all types of regions (image, spatial
 background and order regions) the <TT>spectrumbinning</TT> parameter
 should be used to switch the dispersion plane unit from beta to 
 lambda and vice versa.

<P>
In High Time Resolution (HTR) mode the entire cross-dispersion
 dimension is collapsed into one row, inextricably mixing source and
 background events together.  There is no spatial background region in
 this mode, and all image regions simply outline the exposure map with
 no dependence on source position.  Reproducing the same degenerate
 image region for each source is redundant, of course, but
 nevertheless preferable to specifying a separate region naming
 convention just for HTR mode data.  The missing spatial background
 region is replaced by a collection of order-specific background
 regions in the energy plane.  Throughout this document a <IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="\dag"> marks
 items that do not apply to HTR mode data and a <IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="\ddag"> marks items
 that apply only to HTR mode data.

<P>
The <A NAME="539"></A><TT>SRCLIST</TT> table contains two columns, <A NAME="541"></A><TT>SRC_SELECT</TT>
 and <A NAME="543"></A><TT>BACK_SELECT</TT>, which control the default behavior of
 <A NAME="545"></A><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="../rgsregions/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsregions</SPAN></A>.  Each source with <A NAME="549"></A><TT>SRC_SELECT</TT> set true is

given one image region and an order region for each reflection order
 from one to the value of the <TT>maxorder</TT> parameter.  In HTR mode
 only there is an order background region paired with each order
 region.  The spatial background region is the entire exposed surface
 in the image plane with regions around the more significant
 identified sources excluded: each source with <A NAME="552"></A><TT>BACK_SELECT</TT>
 set true is excluded from this region.  The task parameters,
 <TT>procsrcsexpr</TT> and <TT>exclsrcsexpr</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN>, allow the user to
 override these default selections without having to edit the
 <A NAME="557"></A><TT>SRCLIST</TT> table.  The <TT>procsrcsexpr</TT> expression replaces
 the list derived from <A NAME="560"></A><TT>SRC_SELECT</TT> and the
 <TT>exclsrcsexpr</TT> expression replaces the list derived from
 <A NAME="563"></A><TT>BACK_SELECT</TT>.  Specifying <TT>setflags</TT>=yes (non-default)
 makes these replacements permanent in the <A NAME="566"></A><TT>SRCLIST</TT> table
 itself (in HTR mode <TT>exclsrcsexpr</TT> is ignored and
 <A NAME="569"></A><TT>BACK_SELECT</TT> is set to false for all sources).  The
 selection expressions are parsed in the context of the whole
 <A NAME="571"></A><TT>SRCLIST</TT> table, including all of its columns and attributes.

<P>
The same basic procedure applies to the construction of all regions.
 A region is an assemblage of separate polygons, each corresponding to
 a specific node and source.  Only nodes with an exposure map
 extension in the event list are considered.  The exposure map sets
 the bounding limits of the polygon, and a
 parameter--<TT>spatialres</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN> in the image plane and
 <TT>orderres</TT> in the energy plane--sets the number of opposing
 vertex pairs.  The pairs are distributed evenly across the dispersion
 axis so that the first and last pairs align with the extreme edges of
 the node.  Each vertex in a pair has the same dispersion coordinate
 value, and with the other coordinate the pair spans some portion of
 the applicable model curve: the canonical cross-dispersion PSF in the
 image plane and the canonical pulse-height (PI) distribution in the
 energy plane.  This portion is specified differently for each type of
 region.  Note that in the case of the spatial background region each
 of these polygons define a region that is excluded from the larger
 region defined by the limits of the exposure map.  The list of
 sources excluded from the spatial background region is recorded in
 its extension by a non-standard (not part of the ASC standard)
 attribute, <A NAME="576"></A><TT>EXCLSRCS</TT>.  For all regions (except for HTR image
 regions) the number of vertex pairs per node is recorded by the
 non-standard <A NAME="578"></A><TT>SPACING</TT> attribute.

<P>
The PI limits of an order region (at each vertex pair) are chosen to
 provide the narrowest span that covers at least the specified
 percentage of the model PI distribution.  This percentage is
 specified by the <TT>pdistincl</TT> parameter and is recorded in the
 region extension by the non-standard <A NAME="581"></A><TT>COVERAGE</TT> attribute. And
 additional parameter <TT>picutoff</TT> supplies the minimum cutoff in
PI. For all spatial regions the cross-dispersion off-axis angle of the
 relevant astrophysical source divides the model cross-dispersion PSF
 into two parts: upper and lower.  The upper limit of an image region
 (at each vertex pair) is chosen to cover at least the specified
 percentage of the upper part.  This percentage is specified by the
 <TT>xdspabove</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN> parameter and is recorded in the region
 extension by the non-standard <A NAME="586"></A><TT>COVABOVE</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN> attribute.
 Similarly the lower limit is specified by the <TT>xdspbelow</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN>  parameter, which is recorded as <A NAME="591"></A><TT>COVBELOW</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN>.  For each excluded
 source in the spatial background region a single parameter,
 <TT>xpsfexcl</TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$^{\dag }$"></SPAN>, specifies both the upper and lower limits, and
 is recorded in the region extension as <A NAME="596"></A><TT>COVERAGE</TT>.

<P>
An addition for easing the analysis of extended sources is provided with the
 parameters <TT>xdspregions</TT> and <TT>xdspbackground</TT>. They define
 rectangular regions in (units arcminutes)in cross-dispersion direction. Any
 number of rectangular regions can be defined at once, which may apply to a 
 central
 position of a source defined under <A NAME="600"></A><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="../rgssources/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgssources</SPAN></A>. So, a call to

<A NAME="604"></A><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="../rgsregions/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsregions</SPAN></A>
as following:
<BR> &gt; <code>rgsregions srclist='PxxxSRCLI_0000.FIT' evlist='PxxxEVENLI0000.FIT' xdspregions="-1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0" xdspbackground="1.5 2.0"</code> 
<BR>
will define two "source" rectangular regions with <code>DELTA_XDSP=[1.0,0.0] arcmin</code> 
 and <code>DELTA_XDSP=[0.0,1.0] arcmin</code> respectively and one rectangular
 "background" region with <code>DELTA_XDSP=[1.5,2.0] arcmin</code>.

<P>
The on-board calibration sources are characterized simply as
 rectangles in the energy plane.  These rectangles are always excluded
 from the order regions if there is overlap.  This can usually be seen
 in the second order region, but not in the first order region for an
 on-axis source.  The image plane footprint of the calibration sources
 is not excluded from the spatial regions because that would eliminate
 too many valid photons for off-axis sources.  Another peculiarity of
 the order regions is the silicon edge, where the PI distribution
 function changes shape abruptly.  To ensure that this edge is
 properly resolved, two extra pairs of vertices are added to the
 relevant polygon just on either side of the edge.  The HTR mode order
 background regions are just the regular order regions transformed by
 reflecting each vertex pair vertically around the upper vertex.  To
 avoid overlapping the second-order region the vertex pairs of the
 second-order region are used in the first-order background region for
 chips 1, 2 and 3.

<P>
If the source list already contains a region that <A NAME="608"></A><A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="../rgsregions/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsregions</SPAN></A>
is supposed to add, that region is inspected to determine whether it
 was constructed to the specifications established under the current
 task parameters; if so (or if it is protected) it is left in place,
 otherwise it is deleted and replaced.  A region is considered
 protected if the non-standard <A NAME="612"></A><TT>PROTECT</TT> attribute is missing or
 set true.  The <TT>protect</TT> parameter can be used to mark each
 region added or replaced as protected, and once a region is so marked
 it must be manually deleted by the user before it can be replaced by
 <A NAME="615"></A><A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="../rgsregions/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsregions</SPAN></A>.  This feature should be used very selectively.  At

verbosity level four (Sparse) the name of each region added or
 replaced is noted.

<P>
Two final non-standard attributes of all regions, which are provided
 solely for their diagnostic value, are <A NAME="619"></A><TT>PIX_ENCL</TT> and
 <A NAME="621"></A><TT>PIX_AREA</TT>.  These describe the enclosed area of the region in
 terms of the number of pixels enclosed and the area of a pixel.  The
 dimensions of a pixel are: one dispersion channel width by one
 cross-dispersion channel width in the image plane, and one dispersion
 channel width by one PI unit in the energy plane.  The channel widths
 are as defined in the event list.
