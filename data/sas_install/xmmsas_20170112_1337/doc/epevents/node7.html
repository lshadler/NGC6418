<H3><A NAME="SECTION00032200000000000000">
Analysis of extended sources or 
in the vicinity of moderately bright sources</A>
</H3>

<P>
If <TT>withoutoftime</TT>=y the task does <EM>not</EM> create the ``normal''
events file but uses the input file instead to create an event file 
where all events are <EM>treated</EM> as out-of-time events. 
After the pattern recognition for the same
<A NAME="907"></A><TT>TIME</TT>, <A NAME="909"></A><TT>PHA</TT>, and <A NAME="911"></A><TT>RAWX</TT> a new <A NAME="913"></A><TT>RAWY</TT>
is simulated by randomly shifting the pattern along the RAWY axis
and performing the gain and CTI correction afterwards.
<P>
This out-of-time events file has the same temporal variations and
pattern distribution as the ``normal'' event file. 
All events have an energy correction corresponding to the
(randomly distributed) RAWY column.
You can apply 
the same selection on both the ``normal'' and ``out-of-time'' event file,
scale with a mode-dependent factor and subtract the ``out-of-time''
contribution from the other. You can create ``out-of-time''-corrected
spectra and images for an arbitrary time and energy range by subtracting
the scaled product derived from the out-of-time events file from the
product created from the ``normal'' events file.

<P>
The current (experimental) implementation does not automatically detect the 
instrument and bad pixel setting.
The <A NAME="915"></A><TT>RAWY</TT> range to distribute the out-of-time events is instead 
derived from the <A NAME="917"></A><TT>RAWY</TT> range of the actual events in the data.
The mode-dependent conversion factor has thus to be applied manually
and is about 95% of the out-of-time event fraction (e.g. 0.060 for
full frame mode) due to setting the top 10
rows to ``bad''. This will we improved in later versions.

<P>
For an example how to use the current implementation of
out-of-time event handling in an event file processing, 
consult the documentation of <A NAME="919"></A><A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="../epchain/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">epchain</SPAN></A>. 

<P>
<B>Note</B> that this parameter is only meaningful for IMAGING modes.
Moreover, in the <EM>Large Window</EM> and <EM>Small Window</EM> modes
out-of-time events can be introduced by sources that are outside
the readout-window. 
These cannot be accounted for. 
Similarly, for <EM>Full Frame</EM> and <EM>Extended Full Frame</EM> modes
(currently) the 11 rows closest to the CAMEX are set bad onboard
but sources in these rows may also cause unrecognized out-of-time
events. Finally, if a source is highly affected by pile-up this
feature is projected onto the distribution of out-of-time events as well,
however, the actual recorded out-of-time events do not suffer
from this and thus residual effects remain. 

<P>
