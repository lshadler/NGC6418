ChangeLog for sas
=================

Version 1.580.1 - 2017-01-12 (EO)
---------------
	+ configure_install: Fix perlsed when SAS_PERL is selected.

Version 1.580 - 2017-01-10 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure_install: Function identify_perl enhanced to handle
	  hardcoded "/usr/local/bin/perl" she-bangs, perl scripts with
	  non-printable hidden characters and additional blank space between
	  she-bang "#!" and the perl binary location. 

Version 1.579 - 2016-12-16 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure_install: 
	  - Fixed identify_perl and change_perl functions 
	    to improve detection and change of the perl shebang.
	  - Better identification of errors.

Version 1.578 - 2016-11-17 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  - Removed "-Wc,-fno-common" link option to be passed to
	  GNU g++ linker on Mac OS X. This is not used in Linux and prevented the
	  use of named common blocks from different objects that will form part of
	  a shared library.

Version 1.577 - 2016-10-28 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Added checking on whether GFORTRAN version is greater
	  or equal to 5 or not. If not issue WARNING notice on some Fortran
	  2003 standards will not be supported, e.g. IEEE_ARITHMETIC module
	  used in omcat. 

Version 1.576 - 2016-10-13 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Reinstated missing F90VERSION variable.
	+ sas.environment.in: Replaced GFORTRAN_VERSION by GFORTRANVERSION as
	  this is now the new name of the old variable.
	+ packagedetails.html.in: Replaced GFORTRAN_VERSION by GFORTRANVERSION
	  as this is now the new name of the old variable.

Version 1.575 - 2016-10-11 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Fixed definition of Makefile variable F90.

Version 1.574 - 2016-10-10 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  - No Fortran compiler by default. Both USENAGFORTRAN and USEGFORTRAN
	    are set to "no" by default. Therefore, we must use either 
	    --with-nagfor   -> NAG Fortran compiler
	    --with-gfortran -> GNU Fortran compiler
	  - f95 is not tested anymore to avoid confusion of old f95 from NAG
	    with soft link to gfortran. 
	  - NAG Fortran compiler is searched as nagfor.
	  - NAG Fortran compiler license availability is tested when the NAG 
	    Fortran compiler is set to use.
	  - Removed -Wall for gfortran.
	+ test/tesconfiguremake: The configure now runs with the same options
	  used in the reference build.
	+ AKA: 16.0.0 => Start of release mode for SAS 16.0.0.
	  

Version 1.573 - 2016-08-26 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Given the consequences on source code syntax 
	  produced by using -fpp (NAG) or -cpp (GNU) preprocessor switches 
	  on all Fortran compilations, we have decided to remove them from
	  SASF90FLAGS and SASFFLAGS. 
	  Just for reference of what we have found so far here are two cases
	  which we have observed:
	  - Blank lines can not be used between continuation lines (ended
	  by &).
	  - Standard Fortran comment lines (started with !) can not be ended 
	  with character "\" because this is the preprocessor character used
	  to continue preprocessor lines (those started with #).
	  Therefore, Fortran preprocessor directives MUST be processed by
	  means of code inlcuded ONLY in the individual source Makefiles
	  (src/Makefile). 
	  
	  A good example is the following, that is used to allow to process 
	  the use of the "f90_unix_proc" module only by the NAG Fortran compiler:
	  
	  ifeq ($(USENAGFORTRAN),yes)
	  	F90FLAGS += -fpp -DNAGf90Fortran
	  else
	  	F90FLAGS += -cpp -DGFORTRAN
	  endif
	  
	  This code must be placed after the statement

	  include $(SAS_DIR)Make.include


Version 1.572 - 2016-08-25 (EO)
	+ configure.in: Changes to this file introduced in previous version
	  were not made effective due to forgeting to run the update-configure
	  script.

Version 1.571 - 2016-08-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Added preprocessor switches to both NAG and GNU
	  Fortran compiler compilation flags, SASF90FLAGS, to allow for
	  processing conditional compilation preprocessor directives 
	  embeded in the code, as for example 
	      #ifdef NAGf90Fortran
	      use f90_unix_proc
	      #endif
	  which will load NAG supplied module f90_unix_proc only when NAG
	  Fortran compiler is used (when the macro NAGf90Fortran is included
	  in F90FLAGS).
	  The preprocessor switch is also added to SASFFLAGS.
	  Given that NAG Fortran compiler is still the default Fortran
	  compiler, the default compilation flags SASF90FLAGS and SASFFLAGS 
	  include now the macro -DNAGf90Fortran.
	  This change makes innecessary any possible changes included in local
	  Makefile. 

Version 1.570 - 2016-08-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Added -DGFORTRAN to SASFFLAGS to avoid missing this
	  macro when building .f Fortran programs, e.g. saltec.  
	  Aligned the SASF90FLAGS and SASFFLAGS used for Mac OS X with these
	  for Linux. This operation implied to add -Wall, -fno-range-check and
	  -DGFORTRAN to SASF90FLAGS and -Wall, -fno-range-check and -DGFORTRAN
	  to SASFFLAGS. 

Version 1.569 - 2016-08-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/f90depend: Looking for Fortran compiler dependencies, exclude 
	  any NAG Fortran supplied modules (f90_*) when NAG Fortran compiler 
	  is in use. This situation occurs when the NAG Fortran "lib" 
	  subdirectory (which is part of the NAG Fortran installation) is 
	  included in the list of include directories passed to the script as
	  first argument ($(F90INCFLAGS)). This variable is defined in the SAS Makefile
	  and includes the NAGWare "lib" subdir only when USENAGFORTRAN is set to "yes". 
	  Script documentation updated. 

Version 1.568 - 2016-07-12 (RDS)
-------------
	+ bin/sastaskhdr_nag, bin/sastaskhdr_gfortran:	
	  - Split the sastaskhdr script into two parts so that the
	    module names are set as:
	    NAGf90Fortran: $1_mod_MP_$1
	    gFortran: __$1_mod_MOD_$1

	+ Make.include.in: 
	    uses one of the two sastaskhdr scripts depending on the compiler
	    in use

Version 1.567 - 2016-06-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  - Added -DGFORTRAN to SASCXXFLAGS when -with-gfortran is used (pending change 
	    from previous changes to configure.in).
	  - Added -fno-range-check to SASFFLAGS to support gfortran usage. 

Version 1.566 - 2016-04-06 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  - Added GFORTRAN macro to CXXFLAGS and SASCXXFLAGS 
	  to include specific defintions when the GNU Fortran compiler 
	  is used (--with-gfortran).
	  - Cleaning up of obsolete code. 
	  - Removed g77 and libf2c.
	  - For Mac OS X : Added -bind_at_load option to build shared
	  libraries.
	+ configure_install: Added missing "\" before $platform in setsas.csh. 

Version 1.565 - 2016-02-09 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA = 16.0.0-devel
	+ configure.in: 16.0.0-devel

Version 1.564 - 2015-12-11 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Cleaned from obsolete code.
	+ Make.include.in: Changed sed field separators from / to ? to fix the
	  problem of replacing -sasperl- by $$PT, given that $$PT
	  is a path and includes / as directory separators.

Version 1.563 - 2015-12-02 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 14.0.0 -> 15.0.0
	+ configure.in: 
	  - Updated copyright dates to 1996-2016.
	  - Removed/commented out checks for unsupported Solaris and OSF.
	  - Review variables included from acconfig.h to produce config.h.in.
	  - Removed/commented out obsolete checks for mysql++ and CERN.
	  - Removed obsolete checking for CERN.  
	+ Make.include.in:
	  - Removed obsolete support for CERN, mysql, sfftw and dfftw
	  - Changed the exit 1 by continue in dvipdf execution to avoid
	    breaking the make doc target before processing html and 
	    producing labels.pl, e.g. in cal, which is used by many 
	    packages.
	  - Fixed several typos in target commit for $$branch variable.
	  - Added to git commit message the package version (pkgversion):
	    "$$pkg-$$pkgversion: Committed through make", to improve
	    readability when doing "git log"or "git status" for packages 
	    committed by developers.
	  - Target "upload" modifed:
	  	= Variable needstash is now filtered out for the pkg being uploaded. 
		= "git stash" command changed to "git stash save" with a message
		  that includes the package name and version.
		= git stash pop operation is now exited if failed. 
	  - Target "commit" now includes the pkg version in git commit message.
	  - Removed GNUPERLLDFLAGS variable that was used only on Solaris.
	  - SAS_PERL defined as a function of the PERL value obtained from
	    the configure. This is now used to set -sasperl- in main.pl of 
	    package taskmain. As a consequence, all perl tasks use now in the
	    sha-bang the PERL value determined in the configure. There, a new
	    option to set a valid perl is provided by environment variable
	    SAS_PERL. If not defined, the configure looks for valid perl
	    installations in /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /sw/bin and
	    /opt/local/bin, the last two only on Darwin. 
	    taskmain 1.93 is the first using this mechanism. 
	+ bin/evaluatebuild: Major review to fix some important bugs on
	  elapsed time computation.

Version 1.562 - 2014-09-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/saslibs: Added libquadmath.so to extralibs because many SAS
	  tasks depend now on it after gcc upgrade to 4.8.2.

Version 1.561 - 2014-06-06 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/chkdist: Removed checking of git status to avoid "-" in make check.

Version 1.560 - 2014-04-25 (EC & EO)
------------
	+ Make.include.in: Modified dist, commit and upload targets to include
	  git as a new revision system to work together with a complete SAS package
	  repository under git.
	+ bin/chkdist: Modified to work with git.

Version 1.559 - 2014-04-16 (EO)
-------------
	+ Make.include.in: Modiefied second line of rule %.cc: %.y.
	  Original: mv "$@".h "$(@:.cc=)".h
	  Modified: mv "$(@:.cc=)".hh "$(@:.cc=)".h
	  Historically this rule might not have been working ever.
	  Recently, the past_ly script used in package selectlib (src/selcore)
	  to touch time stamps of SelectParser.y and SelectLexer.l to be always 
	  01 Jan 2000, such as they keep always older than SelectParser.cc and
	  SelectLexer.cc, failed to run. The reason was the syntax of the touch
	  command used in past_ly was obsolete and did not work. Therefore, 
	  recently uploaded package selectlib-4.71 incorporated new SelectParser.cc and 
	  SelectLexer.cc as generated by bison (2.4.1) and flex (2.3.35). 
	  Together with SelectParser.cc, the bison command created SelectParser.hh
	  that has to be "moved" to SelectParser.h. This transformation failed
	  due to the wrong syntax of the rule changed with this fix.
	   

Version 1.558 - 2014-03-14 (EO)
-------------
	+ doc/lib/sasglobal: New alias \CALHBOOK for the "Calibration Access 
	  and Data Handbook" URL.
	+ Files prepared for SAS 14.0.0: AKA, configugre.in and Make.include.in.

Version 1.557 - 2013-12-09 (EO)
-------------
	+ sas-setup.csh.in: Corrected typo in setting perlpath.
	+ configure_sas: Unset/unsetenv SAS_PATH in setsas.(c)sh scripts before
	  sourcing sas-setup.(c)sh.

Version 1.556 - 2013-10-21 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/mktophtml: Suppressed link to SSC http site.
	+ doc/lib/SAS.pm: Changed base http URL and email.
	+ README.html: Supressed link to SSC http site in base documentation.
	+ AKA=13.5.0
	+ sas-setup.(c)sh.in:
	  - Added as default SAS_VERBOSITY=4
	  - Added as default SAS_SUPPRESS_WARNING=1, until now set only for 
	    development.
	+ configure_install: 
	  1) setsas.sh (Bash): Replaced "exit" by "return 1" to avoid exiting
	  in case of an error.
	  2) setsas.csh (csh/tcsh): Kept "exit" but added "1" to it.
	  3) setsas.csh (csh/tcsh): Added check for (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH being
	  undefined, to avoid breaking the script when these two variables are used
	  in setting the values of SAS_PREV_(DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
	  1) and 2) were included in the public release but not commited.  
	  

Version 1.555 - 2013-04-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure_install: 
	  1) Fixed typo in "cputype" withing identify_perl function.
	  2) Fixed function change_perl to create single .old backup file.
	  3) Fixed csh/tcsh for undefined (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables by adding the
	     checking of LHEASOFT to setsas.(c)sh scripts.

Version 1.554 - 2013-04-17 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: Forgotten in previous version ... now really set to 13.0.0.
	+ configure_install:
	  1) Provided that readlink has not the -f option on Mac OS X, use other
	  tools to get the cannonical location of /usr/local/bin/perl when is a 
	  symlink. 
	  2) Added SAS_PREV_PATH, SAS_PREV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and 
	  SAS_PREV_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables to store the PATH, 
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH settings prior to a SAS initialization.
	  By checking whether SAS_PREV_PATH is set or not, we can restore the 
	  values of these shell vriables prior to their values before SAS was
	  initialized. This feature allows to assure that any initialization 
	  of SAS does not take settings from a previous one.

Version 1.553 - 2013-04-15 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 13.0.0
	+ bin/evaluatebuild: Fixed display of the version number of dependent package.
	  Take build_log_${host} (alternately build_log) file change time to compute 
	  end time of build.

Version 1.552 - 2013-04-11 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure_intsall: 
	  1) Added SAS_PERL environment variable. It lets the user set a specific 
	  installed perl to be used for SAS perl executables replacing /usr/local/bin/perl. 
	  Otherwise it will identify the available perl installed in the system.
	  2) For /usr/local/bin/perl, added a second check on whether the ELF type of the
	  that perl matches or not the kernel bit word length, 32-bit or 64-bit. Only
	  if they match, i.e. both are 32-bit or 64-bit, that perl is used. Otherwise
	  the install script looks for another available perl, e.g. /usr/bin/perl.
	  This is set to avoid using 32-bit perl binaries available in 
	  /usr/local/bin on machines with 64-bit kernels. Despite this could be done,
	  this criteria forces to look for a true 64-bit perl, usually in /usr/bin/perl.
	+ bin/evaluatebuild: Refurbished. Added failure categories FATAL, TEST and DOC.
	  Thete report (evaluatebuild.txt) is changed to show the packages that depend 
	  only on FATAL failures.
	  Also added the detailed building statistics including build-time values for each
	  package and the whole build.
	+ bin/evaluateReport: Changed to accept the new output format of evaluatebuild.txt
	  to be transformed into evaluatebuild.html.
	+ bin/htmlReport: Added AKA. Kernel info (uname -a) substituted by short information 
	  on OS and kernel version. 
	+ install: AKA file is copied instead of symlinked to top directory. This way
	  can be examined in build reports

Version 1.551 - 2013-04-05 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure_install: Added already in previous version.
	  Added two new functions: identify_perl and change_perl.
	  The first allows to check for an installation of perl in four given 
	  places: /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /opt/local/bin and /sw/bin.
	  The second allows to change the default perl sha-bang in all SAS perl tasks
	  and perl source code in lib/perl5, to the perl identified by the previous 
	  function, according to the folloowing criteria: 
	  - If a perl is found in /usr/local/bin either as a real binary or as a 
	    symlink to other, it takes this one. Otherwise takes /usr/bin/perl if
	    present.
	  - If none of the previous two is fulfilled, will take either /opt/local/bin
	    or /sw/bin installed perl.
	  If none of them is found, exists and requests the user to install perl.

Version 1.550 - 2013-04-05 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 13.0.0-Beta.
	+ bin/chkdist: For each package info, lyt and par files for each task
	  will only be considered if they are found within the ./config subdir.

Version 1.549 - 2013-02-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 13.0.0-Alpha. Start release mode for SAS 13.
	+ Minor updates in several files.

Version 1.548 - 2012-11-21 (EO)
-------------
	+ aclocal.m4: Replaced ${CXX} in AC_TRY_LINK_F90 by ${F90} in link stage.
	  From nagfor 5.3 onwards link stage must be done with nagfor not with g++.
	  This feature is not affected by "-Wc"option in nagfor script.
	+ configure.in: Removed wrong note abouth libf95.a for 64 bit.

Version 1.547 - 2012-07-30 (EO)
-------------
	+ Change of masterbuilder to sasbld01. 

Version 1.546.1 - 2012-07-02 (EO)
---------------
	+ AKA: Fixed typo.

Version 1.546 - 2012-06-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: devel. Back to development mode.

 1.545.1 - 2012-06-21 (EO)
---------------
	+ AKA: 12.0.1. 
	  Patched version of SAS 12.0.0 with the following updated packages:
	  - arfgen-1.83.4
	  - rgslccorr-0.52.1
	  - epatplot-1.16.1
	  - catcorr-0.4.4
	  - barycen-1.20.2
	  - eexpmap-4.6.5
	  - edetect_chain-3.12.2
	  - emldetect-5.17.4
	  - emask-2.13.3
	  - ewavelet-3.11.2
	  - eboxdetect-4.22.3

Version 1.545 - 2012-05-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure_install: Added 1 to exit due to error, to allow capture of error by
	  the installation script 'install.sh".

Version 1.544 - 2012-05-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 12.0.0
	+ doc/REDAME/install.html: removed.

Version 1.543 - 2012-05-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA = 12.0.0-Beta§
	+ sas-setup.sh.in: Make this script compatible to users of Z-shell.
	+ sas-setup.csh.in/sh.in: Set $TEXINPUT and $BIBINPUTS only in SAS building
	  when $SAS_DIR/packages/sas/doc/lib exists.
	+ configure.in: 
	  1) NAG Fortran Optimiztion level (F90OLEVEL) on Mac OS X set to the same 
	  value that is set on Linux, OLEVEL=2.
	  2) Added --enable-force64 to be able to force building 64-bit on a 32-bit
	  kernel.

Version 1.542 - 2012-04-11 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Re-stated the tests to determine the behaviour of
	  the command echo on Mac OS X. From Snow Leopard onwards, 
	  /bin/echo -nx is equivalent to echo 'x\c', which is not 
	  the GNU standard behaviour as in Linux echo tool.
	+ configure_install: Fixed checking the presence of perl.

Version 1.541 - 2012-03-28 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 12.0.0-Alpha

Version 1.540 - 2011-05-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: PROCESSOR variable is set via 'uname -p' which on
	Ubuntu 64 bit kernels provides 'unknown' instead of 'x86_64. 
	Since 64 bit building is based on the proper identification of the
	PROCESSOR variable, we have changed to 'uname -m', which provides on all
	systems the right value.

Version 1.539 - 2011-05-06 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: SASLDFLAGS was set to -s despite of the value of DEBUG, which
	  caused that even when DEBUG was requested, binaries did not contain 
	  any debug information. Fixed.

Version 1.538 - 2011-03-22 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/mkpkgidx: In getInfo fixed reading DISTRIBUTION file for those who
	  have additionoal blank lines.

Version 1.537 - 2011-03-14 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/mkpkgidx: Fixed getinfo routine to consider packages with one or
	  more tasks, e.g. epicproc with epproc and emproc.

Version 1.536 - 2011-02-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: devel. Back to development mode.
	+ bin/saslibs: Fixed wrong symlinking in libextra.

Version 1.535 - 2011-02-22 (EO)
-------------
	+ doc/lib/SAS.pm: Updated.
	+ bin/mkpkgidx: 
	  - Function getInfo modified to process only public
	  packages.
	  - Added command option -p to select the
	  processing of public packages. Default option is to process all packages.
	  - Public packages html pages are identified with (Public) appended 
	  to [xmmsas_YYYYMMDD_HHMM] tag in the upper right corner of each page.
	  - PS links replaced by PDF.
	+ Makefile.top:
	  - Target packages_html can create a top level
	  documentation HTML page in doc/ ONLY for public (world) packages,
	  depending on the environment variable SAS_PUBLIC_DOC set to yes.
	  - New target exclude-list-mac to produce the list of
	  files excluded on mac release with versioned libraries and a
	  shared-suffix=dylib.
	+ bin: All scripts updated.
	+ bin/saslibs: Extensively modified to handle properly all SAS
	binaries and libraries dependencies on SAS, external tools and OS
	libraries.

Version 1.534 - 2011-02-21 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 11.0.0

Version 1.533 - 2011-02-09 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 11.0.0-Beta
	+ sas-setup.sh.in: Restated export as standalone command to be compliant
	  with old Bourne shell (/bin/sh).

Version 1.532 - 2011-02-04 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: config.h.in text amended.
	+ configure.in: Added missing fields in AC_INIT.
	+ sas-setup.(c)sh.in: Handling DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH with independence of 
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to avoid messing them up between Linux and Mac.

Version 1.531 - 2011-01-19 (EO)
-------------
	+ Wrong date set in version 1.530 (2010-11-30). Updated below to
	2011-01-18.
	+ AKA incorrectly set to 11.0.0. Ammended to 11.0.0-Alfa.
	+ Make.include.in: Removed debugging statements left in versioned 
	shared lib processing.
	+ Make.include.in: Fixed wrong target ordering for versioned shared
	libraries in Mac OS X. The $(LIBDIR)/lib%.$(SO_FULL_EXT) target MUST
	be before the $(LIBDIR)/lib%.$(SO) target. Otherwise, soft linking
	is made incorrectly.
	+ configure.in: Now SASLDFLAGS is set to "-s" by default in this
	stage. This option implies to strip executables at linking stage, 
	unless debug or profiling are requested. 
	The -s option to GNU ld is accepted by Linux and Solaris GNU ld
	but it is not for BSD GNU's ld on Darwin. 
	This option is not set anymore in the Make.include as it was until
	mow.

Version 1.530 - 2011-01-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 11.0.0-Alfa
	+ configure.in: SASCFLAGS removed -fpermissive. C++ only option.
	+ sas-setup.sh.in: Cleaned up. 
	+ configure_install: Added unset/unsetenv SAS_PATH to allow for SAS
	version reset.
	+ Make.include.in: Added EXTPERLMODS, EXTPERLDIR and EXTPERLSCRIPT to 
	handle the building of external perl modules for a perl task.
	Added a new target of the make named "extperlmods". It is included in
	the TARGETS variable, which contains all targets to be done for "make
	bin". As a consequence, the invocation of "make bin" or "make check"
	will launch the execution of target extperlmods.
	+ Fixed shared library numbering issue on Mac OS X.

Version 1.529 - 2010-11-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Set to undefined CHRLEN_SIZE_64 on 64 bit systems.

Version 1.528 - 2010-11-26 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA : 10.5.0

Version 1.527 - 2010-11-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ Fixed syntax typo in SASCFLAGS when setting OBJECT_SIZE_64.

Version 1.526 - 2010-11-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in:
	  - SAS_AKA by default is now devel (before was dt).
	  - Checking of cut, whoami, strings, awk, head moved ahead in file.
	  - Coded identification of ScientificLinux and Ubuntu OS in
	    TARGET_OS.
	  - Fixed identification of gfrotran version value.
	  - Added -DOBJECT_SIZE_64 and -DCHRLEN_SIZE_64 to SASCXXFLAGS
	    and SASCFLAGS, when the kernel is 64 bit.


Version 1.525 - 2010-05-07 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: devel. To be used in the development track.
	+ bin/mktophtml: removed reference to old SOC http hostname.

Version 1.524 - 2010-04-22 (EO)
-------------
	*** Following changes were made to improve package distribution ***
	+ Make.include.in: Include TARGET_OS as defined by configure.in
	+ Makefile.top: Add variables TAKA (based on AKA), TOS and LCPU (based on TARGET_OS)
	  to re-define TARBASE and TARBASECOM for tar.gz archive creation.
	+ bin/saslibs: 
	  - Updated the components of @extralibs: 
	    libcfitsio  : CFITSIO 
	    libfftw3    : FFTW 3.X
	    libfftw3f   : FFTW 3.X Floating
	    libgcc_s    : gcc 3.3.6 and 4.3.3 (in fact any gcc)
	    libstdc++   : Any gcc
	    libgfortran : Since gcc 4.X 
	    libg2c      : Still for those using gcc 3.3.X
	    libpgplot   : PGPLOT legacy code
	    libqt       : Qt 3.3.X
	  - Regarding these libraries Linux and Mac OS X are now treated the same.
	  - Fixed mistake in looking for %extralibs components. 

Version 1.523 - 2010-04-15 (EO)
-------------
	+ sas-setup.(c)sh: 
	  1) If LHEASOFT is not defined, the script exits (return 1) with error.
	  2) Now sets PGPLOT_FONT to $SAS_DIR/libextra/grfont.dat. Check first for it.
	  3) Fixed issues about usage of return/exit in bash/tcsh scripts.
	+ configure_install:
	  1) Removed setting of SAS_PATH in setsas.(c)sh generated scripts. This 
	  variable is set by sas-setup.(c)sh if not defined.
	  2) Removed setting of DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Darwin. This is done
	  already by sas-setp.(c)sh.
	  3) Added unsetting SAS_DIR if already set to avoid mixing SAS versions.
	  
Version 1.522 - 2006-04-08 (EO)
-------------
	+ AKA: 10.0.0

Version 1.521.2 - 2010-03-26 (EO)
---------------
	+ test/testconfiguremake: Fixed cleaning of dir lib/data/tm/sastest, after test.
	+ configure.in: Set exit condition (AC_MSG_ERROR) when HEADAS/LHEASOFT variable not 
	  defined. Until now, configure exited only when FTOOLS fversion was not found, because
	  it is required by some tests. Now HEADAS is added as a mandatory condition to build
	  and run SAS.
	+ sas-setup.sh(c)sh: Fixed bug to define SAS_BROWSER. On Mac OS X this is set to
	  "open -a Safari". Double quotes are mandatory. Otherwise, sas-setup.sh exits with
	  error "-a : comand not found".

Version 1.521.1 - 2010-03-25 (EO)
---------------
	+ sas-setup.sh.in: Fixed checking of HEADAS/HEASOFT presence.

Version 1.521 - 2010-03-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ sas-setup.(c)sh.in: Reorganized+fixed DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH checking.
          Included test of HEADAS/HEASOFT.
	+ Make.include.in: 
	  - SLOPPY = @SLOPPY@ from configure with --enable-sloppy option.
	  - In case SLOPPY=no, removed -Werror in CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS to process mysql++.
	  - Added USENAGFORTRAN and USEGFORTRAN to info target.
	+ configure.in: Included check/definition of SAS_BROWSER="open -a Safari" in Mac OS X.

Version 1.520 - 2010-03-10 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  1) Restated checking for -freg-struct-return option in NAG Fortran
	  compiler. Despite of being obsolete, this option is required on Solaris.
	  Its absence makes executables to crash with Segmentation Faults.
	  2) Include the SLOPPY setting as a configure option via --enable-sloppy.
	  The SLOPPY=yes is the default which corresponds to --enable-sloppy=yes
	  The default (SLOPPY=yes) is taken in absence of any --enable-sloppy switch.
	  3) Added information on the default values for each available optional 
	  switch when the configure is invoked with the --help switch.
	  4) Added GNUCCPATH and GNUCXXPATH varaibles to give the gcc/g++ full
	  path specification of the gcc/g++ executables. 
	+ AKA file: 10.0.0-Beta.

Version 1.519.1 - 2010-02-27 (EO)
---------------
	+ configure.in: Fix typo in gfortran option "-fimplicit-none".
	+ bin/uploadreport: Add AKA to list of the files included in the report.

Version 1.519 - 2010-02-26 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  1) In AC_ARG_ENABLE for "sharedversion" feature (--enable-sharedversion),
	  feature was set to "shared" instead of "sharedversion". Such a syntax error
	  made this configure option did not work until now. Fixed.
	  2) Fix output from GNU_FIND evaluation.
	  3) Add -fno-range-check to SASF90FLAGS when Fortran compiler is gfortran.
	+ install: Added AKA file to LINKS.

Version 1.518 - 2010-02-25 (EO)
-------------
	+ Release mode activated today to produce SAS 10.0.0. Development track manifest
	  creation stopped. Release track manifest creation started.
	+ AKA file: dt replaced by 10.0.0-Alpha. It will produce the AKA in Make.include.
	+ Changes from devel to user doc (--enable-user=no/yes) and to shared versioned
	  libraries (--enable-sharedversion=yes except for the Mac OS X), are now made 
	  through sasbuilder/sasconf files build.setup.rtuserdoc and build.setup.macuserdoc.

Version 1.517 - 2010-02-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Added missing checking of libgfortran when USEGFORTRAN=yes. 
	  If present, -lgfortran is added to LIBS then to LDLIBS in the Make.include. 

Version 1.516 - 2010-02-24 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  1) Fix bug in setting F90_PIC_FLAG, SASF90FLAGS and SASFFLAGS when USEGFORTRAN
	     is set to yes (--with-gfortran).
	  2) Remove type "-DGFotran" in SASCXXFLAGS when USEGFORTRAN is set to yes.
	  3) Fix setting of SASF90FLAGS and SASFFLAGS for Darwin.
	+ packagedetails.html.in: Added missing @DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH@.
	+ sas.environment.in: Added missing @DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH@.

Version 1.515 - 2010-02-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  1) Use -DNAGf90Fortran instead of a specific -DGFORTRAN when 
	  requested to use gfortran instead of NAG Fortran, until we
	  find a proper solution.
	  2) Remove any output in GNUAR_VERSION when it is not GNU ar.
	+ bin/uploadreport: Replace system call by qx for tar.gz creation.
	  At difference with system, qx waits until the tar.gz is complete.

Version 1.514 - 2010-02-03 (EO)
-------------
	+ backward-gcc: Removed. References to it in configure.in/Make.include.in, removed.
	+ Makefile: Deleted INTERFACES which contained backward-gcc.
	+ Reviewed configure_install.
	+ Reviewed Makefile.top.
	+ configure.in: SAS_AKA by default is always equal to "dt" unless we edit it and change
	  it to something else. 
	+ Make.include.in: AKA :== @SAS_AKA@
	+ reviewed Make.include.perl.in.
	+ Altought acconfig.h was not needed anymore (and it was renamed to N-acconfig.h),
	  it has been removed since this version on.
	+ packagedetails.html.in: 
	  - Replaced GNU_AR by GNUAR.
	  - F2C removed.
	  - Added USENAGFORTRAN and USEGFORTRAN.
	+ Reviewed README and README.html files.
	+ README.develop updated.
	+ Updated sas.environment.in (ASCII version of packagedetails.html.in).
	+ Reviewed sas-setup.csh.in: Added \$Id\$.
	+ Reviewed sas-setup.sh.in: Added \$Id\$.
	+ Reviewed test/testconfiguremake.
	+ Reviewed testdoc.
	+ Reviewed doc. dataconv document quite obsolete.

Version 1.513 - 2010-01-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ Make.include.in: Previous edit of this file eliminated by mistake INCS definition.
	  Fixed.

Version 1.512 - 2010-01-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ Make.include.in: 
	  - CXXFIXINC was missing due to removed obsolete check in configure.in. Removed.  
	  - AR missing due to renamed variable in configure.in to GNUAR. Fixed.


Version 1.511 - 2010-01-28 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Restated AC_SUBST for STRUCT_CXXFLAGS and STRUCT_CFLAGS. 
	  These two variables were left undefined in Make.include.in which caused 
	  all builds to fail.
	+ configure.in: For some freaky systems having gfortran but not libgfortran,
	  we have added a check of libgfortran to the test for compiling and linking
	  a small pgplot program.

Version 1.510 - 2010-01-27 (EO)
-------------
	+ Changes in configure.in:
	  - Moved ahead of script the checking of basic tools (cut, whoami, strings, awk, head). 
	  - Moved ahead of script the TARGET_OS determination.
	  - Added new option --with-gfortran to use GNU Fortran as alternative to NAG Fortran. 
	    . Default: --with-gfortran=no (--without-gfortran). USEGFORTRAN=no, USENAGFORTRAN=yes
	    . Alternative: --with-gfortran=yes. USEGFORTRAN=yes, USENAGFORTRAN=no.
	  - USENAGFORTRAN and USEGFORTRAN, together with remaining options, showed in output. 
	  - Improved checking GNU tools (GNU make).
	  - Fixed checking GNU and non-GNU ar tool (Mac OS X).
	  - Removed checking of f2c.
	  - Improved fversion checking.
	  - Enhanced gfortran, f95, nagfor checking. Included test for --with-gfortran option.
	  - Added Fortran compiler selection in F90 varaible.
	  - Removed obslete check for freg-struct-return.
	  - F90_PIC_FLAG set always to -Wc,-fPIC
	  - Added new values of SASF90FLAGS and SASFFLAGS for GNUFORTRAN.
	  - Enhanced definition of SASCXXFLAGS and SASCFLAGS for SLOPPY=yes/no.
	  - Enhanced C/C++ for ~GNU C/C++ GCC determination.
	  - Enhanced definition of Optimization levels.
	  - Enhanced library checking.
	  - Check for NAG Fortran library only when USENAGFORTRAN = yes.
	  - Check compile and link of a small f90/f95 program only when USENAGFORTRAN = yes.
	  - Fixed bug in libgfortran inclussion into pgplot small program compile/link.
	  - Removed pgopen/pgclos obsolete checking in pgplot.
	  - Provide code to check for compilation&linking of a small pgplot program when 
	    USEGFORTRAN = yes. New functions AC_TRY_LINK_GFORTRAN and AC_TRY_COMPILE_GFORTRAN.
	+ Successful test of new configure.in on all supported platforms.
	+ Changes to aclocal.m4:
	  - New function AC_TRY_LINK_GFORTRAN to compile and link a conftest.f90 program with gfortran.
	  - New function AC_TRY_COMPILE_GFORTRAN to compile only a conftest.f90 program with gfortran.
 	+ Changes to Make.include.in:
	  - Add to procedure the new variables USENGAFORTRAN and USEGFORTRAN.
	  - F90FLAGS and FFLAGS set to only -g90 for NAG Fortran (removed -g to be in agreement with NAG 
	    recommendation).
	  - F90FLAGS and FFLAGS set to -g only for GNU Fortran.
	  - Restrict NAGSUPMODS use to USENAGFORTRAN=yes. This is different for GNU Fortran.

Version 1.499 - 2009-05-08 (EO)
-------------
	+ Release mode ON. Release manifest creation switched on.
	+ this version is for track release. Next one is for mac track.
	+ Make.include.in: 
	  - AKA := 9.0.0 - Beta
	+ configure.in:
	  - SHAREDVERSION=yes

Version 1.498 - 2009-04-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: On Mac OS X, when gcc major version = 4
	  removed from SASCXXFLAGS the -Wno-long-double and 
	  -fno-coalesce-templates. 
	  These are kept for previous gcc versions.

Version 1.497 - 2009-04-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ Make.include.in: Fixed detection of f95/nagfor in NAGSUPMODS

Version 1.496 - 2009-04-14 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Fixed condition to add -fpermissive.

Version 1.495 - 2009-04-13 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in:
	  * Modified TARGET_OS definition for SuSE targets.
	  * Added checking for environment variable PERMISSIVE: If set
	    to yes, then enable -fpermissive gcc/g++ flag 
	    (SASCFLAGS and SASCXXFLAGS).

Version 1.494 - 2009-03-26 (EO)
-------------
	+ doc/lib/sas.bib: Two new bibliographical references included
	  (on behalf of C.M. Hubert Chen)

Version 1.493 - 2009-03-06 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Added CPU word length (32/64 bits) to TARGET_OS.

Version 1.492 - 2009-03-06 (EO)
-------------
	+ Fixed typo in the definition of CXXFLAGS

Version 1.491 - 2009-03-06 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Fixed checking of libf95 when $F90 is nagfor.

Version 1.490 - 2009-02-23 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	  * Added test for NAG Fortran Compiler version 5.2. 
	    With this version they changed the name of the 
	    binary from f95 to nagfor.
	    Now the configure must check both f95 for compatibility 
	    with f95 NAG Fortran (until version 5.1) and for new nagfor.
	    On some systems (e.g. RHEL5 64) besides the f95 NAG Fortran 
	    Compiler, there exists an f95 Fortran Compiler, which is 
	    usually a soft link to the GNU gfortran Fortran Compiler.
	    Therefore, configure.in must be able to distinguish between
	    the old f95 (versions 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1) NAG Fortran Compiler,
	    the f95 as gfortran and the new NAG nagfor.
	  * Despite no changes were made to the specific code 
	    to check for the "echo" command, it does not work in Solaris. 
	    Due to the higher version of autoconf (2.63) as compared to
	    the one on Solaris (2.13), configure can not capture properly 
	    how to work with Solaris echo. As a fix, the macro to check
	    for echo has been modified as follows:
	    AC_PATH_PROG(ECHO,echo,echo,/bin:/usr/bin) is replaced by
	    AC_PATH_PROG(ECHO,echo,echo,)
	    The consequence is that echo is looked for in the PATH
	    variable set by the builder for software builds. 
	    We recommend to put GNU echo in such a PATH (GNU coreutils).
	  * Added code to define TARGET_OS for SunOS (Solaris).

Version 1.489 - 2009-02-10 (EO)
-------------
	+ bin/uploadsas: pgp replaced by gpg (GnuPG).
	  New gpg keys requested to developers.
	  Old pgp keys still usable as far as local change in uploadsas
	  to continue using pgp.

	+ lib/SasServer.pm: xmm.vilspa.esa.es replaced by xmm.esac.esa.int.

Version 1.488 - 2009-02-05 (EO)
-------------
	+ fancyheadings/fancyhdr: The fix included with previuos
	  verion is wrong: If both files are present, both are
	  loaded which results in a LaTeX processing error.
	  On all supported OS (Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris),
	  both styles, fancyheadings and fancyhdr, are present.
	  On recent versions of Linux, fancyheadings is
	  replaced by more modern fancyhdr.
	  Adopted fix: Get off fancyheadings in favor of fancyhdr.
	+ sas-setup.(c)sh: Wrong variable name SAS$BROWSER defined.
	  Right name is SAS_BROWSER.

Version 1.487 - 2009-02-03 (EO)
-------------
	+ doc/lib/sasbook.cls, sasdoc.cls and userguide.cls: 
	  Latest Linux distros use fancyhdr.sty as a replacement
	  for fancyheadings.sty, which is not provided anymore.
	  To solve the problem while keeping the code backwards
	  compatible with old Linux distros, the following
	  modification has been made in these three files:
	  Replace 
	     \RequirePackage{fancyheadings}
	  by
	     \RequirePackage{fancyheadings,fancyhdr}
	  since the latex2e command RequirePackage{packages} allows to
	  specify several sty files separated by commas.

Version 1.486 - 2009-02-02 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Refined the determination of GCC c/c++ and
	  gfortran versions.

Version 1.485 - 2009-01-30 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: Added check for libgfortran to add such library
	  to PGPLOT_LIBS if present. 
	+ configure.in: Fixed checking of TARGET_OS for latest Fedora
	  distributions.

Version 1.484 - 2009-01-29 (EO)
-------------
	+ configure.in: 
	 - Fixed gfortran determination when OS already provides one.
	 - Fixed ds9 version checking. Obsolete code removed.
	 - Added checking for mozilla or firefox to set SAS_BROWSER.
	+ sas-setup.(c)sh.in: Added SAS$BROWSER.

Version 1.483 - 2009-01-22 (EO)
-------------
	+ acconfig.h: The use of this file to generate config.h.in is
	  deprecated and discouraged. Since autoconf/autoheader 2.61, 
	  the contents of this file is included into configure.in.
	  To generate config.h.in now, autoheader scans configure.in
	  and produces config.h.in.
	+ configure.in/AC_CONFIG_HEADER: The macro AC_CONFIG_HEADER 
	  is now AC_CONFIG_HEADERS. The syntax to generate config.h.in
	  within the sas package main dir is
	           AC_CONFIG_HEADERS(config.h:config.h.in)
	+ update-configure: In order to generate the config.h.in file
	  from the configure.in file, it is enough to rin the autoheader
	  as follows:
	   autoheader
	  Therefore, the only contents of update-confiure now is
	   autoconf
	   autoheader
	  Additionaly, the script removes the autom4te.cache file 
	  which is created for each run of autoconf.
	  The new update-configure can be run on any modern system
	  with recent versions of autoconf/autoheader. Tested in 
	  Fedora 8 and RHEL 5.
	+ configure.in: extensive re-writing of the file. Main issues:
	  * Included acconfig.h code into it. Macros used: 
	    - AH_VERBATIM(key,template)
	    - AH_TOP(text)
	  * AC_CONFIG_HEADER replaced by AC_CONFIG_HEADERS macro.
	  * Included checking for HEADAS env variable besides LHEASOFT.
	  * Removed the code that determines the ds9 version because
	    it does not work anymore. No replacement found since 
	    ds9 -version only works when DISPLAY is set which is not 
	    the proper way when builds are run from crontabs.
	  * Added checking for gfortran. GFORTRAN variable added.
	    Added GFORTRAN_VERSION variable as well.
	  * Added checking for dvipdf to create pdf documentation.
	  * Fixed checking for CC, CCVERSION and CXXVERSION variables
	  * Fixed the code in FIX CPATH.
	  * Added checking of X11 libraries and includes on /usr/lib and
	    /usr/include.
	  * Fixed capture of cfitsio version 2 and 3, an min. version 2.400.
	  * Added libgfortran.so and the -L~/local/gcc_${CCVERSION} dir
	    to list of required LIBS to compile and link a small pgplot
	    program.
	  * Since gfortran can also be installed as a system binary 
	    (usually under /usr/bin), a check is done here to assure 
	    the gfortran version is the same that gcc version.
	  * Added code to reduce TARGET_OS to mnemotecnic names.
	+ Make.include.in: Added directory autom4te.cache to CLEANFILES.
	  This directory is produced by autoconf.
	+ configure_install: Modified stacksize max limit to 65532 (instead
	  of 65536).
	+ packagedetails.html.in: Added GFORTRAN, GFORTRAN_VERSION and DVIPDF.
	+ sas.environment.in:  Added GFORTRAN, GFORTRAN_VERSION and DVIPDF.
	+ README.html: Updated. Pending: doc/README/install.html
	+ install: Added config.h.in to the list of LINKS, just to allow the
	  testconfiguremake to succeed.
	+ lib/perl5/Pod/Usage.pm (version 1.16): The perl module had a bug in
	  line 532. The fix was replacing Usage.pm by version 1.36.
	+ test/testconfiguremake: removed "type gmake" since configure already
	  tests we are really using GNU make.
Version 1.482 - 2008-10-08 (EO)
-------------
	+ Make.include.in: Include code to check for gcc version
	  Variables: GCCVERS, MAJOR_GCCVERS and MINOR_GCCVERS.

Version 1.481 - 2008-07-04 (EO)
-------------
	+ Back to development mode. Version for development track
	  SHAREDVERSION=no (configure.in)
          AKA := dt (Make.include.in)

Version 1.480 - 2008-06-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ version for the mac track

Version 1.479 - 2008-06-18 (EO)
-------------
	+ Makefile.include.in: New variable NAGSUPMODS which can be set
	  to yes when NAG supplied modules are required, as for

	and 
	F90INCFLAGS += $(addprefix -I,$(shell $(SASBIN)/findinclude $(USEDLIBS)))
	by 
	F90INCFLAGS += $(addprefix -I,$(shell $(SASBIN)/findinclude $(sort $(USEDLIBS))))
	This way elliminates excesive amount of Include dirs which give problems with f95.

Version 1.408 - 2003-09-12 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) Implement the requirement that tasks making
	use of param also need qt without using EXTERNALS = qt. This in an
	attempt to make it possible to run tasks in the background without
	first unsetting the environment variable DISPLAY.

Version 1.407 - 2003-08-05 (GV)
-------------
	+ When running the second test make sure that the test log is
	first erased. In an incremental build the test log is left
	behind, and one wants to be sure that it is re-created from
	scratch.
	
Version 1.406 - 2003-07-31 (EO)
-------------
	+ No changes to code.
	Changed back in Make.include.in the AKA to dt.
	Changed back the SHAREDVERSION to no in configure.in
	
Version 1.405.2 - 2003-07-30 (EO)
---------------
        + No changes to code. Made for the soctrack.
        SHAREDVERSION in configure.in set to yes (not done before).

Version 1.405.1 - 2003-07-30 (EO)
---------------
        + No changes to code. Made for the soctrack.
	AKA in Make.include.in changed to soc.
	SHAREDVERSION in configure.in set to yes.

Version 1.405 - 2003-06-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ (mkpkgidx) Change wording of entries in index page from 'Index
	of x' to 'Index of x referenced in the documentation'. SOC-SPR-2413.

Version 1.404 - 2003-06-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) Change the way awk is called when make commit
	is called, so that this works on Mac OS X. SOC-SPR-2448.
	
Version 1.403 - 2003-06-25 (GV)
-------------
	+ (testconfiguremake) Step out of the current directory before
	deleting it at the end of the test.

Version 1.402 - 2003-06-24 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) Using --enable-strict=no no longer skips the Qt
	checks because Qt is required for param to work.

Version 1.401 - 2003-06-20 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Makefile.top) Make the binary archive targets more verbose.
	
Version 1.400 - 2003-06-18 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure) Check that Qt has DOM support. This is needed for
	the parameter interface to work, but some commercial licenses
	don't have it.
	
Version 1.399 - 2003-06-17 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) I had accidentally disabled SLOPPY.
	+ (makefile.top) Rework all of the binary making commands. Make
	use of both the saslibs and the listxcluded scripts.

Version 1.398 - 2003-06-11 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) On Mac OS X add further flags to
	SHARED_LIBS_FLAGS so that the libraries are created with the full
	path (-install_name). In this manner when a task is linked against
	libX, with libX linked against libY, the system finds libY even if
	the latter is not explicitly given on the link line.
	
Version 1.397 - 2003-06-03 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) Add ';' after the if/then/else/fi structure
	that determines whether the full documentation should be built for
	an incremental build. This is what proper Bourne shells want.
	+ Add development script saslibs, a helper script used to make
	binary distributions.
	+ Remove old scripts: uploadreport.csh constructManifest paramconv
	sascommit checkReport incheckReport buildReport
	+ (Makefile.top) Run the saslibs script before creating the binary
	archives.
	
Version 1.396 - 2003-06-02 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) The incremental build now builds also the html
	documentation. This can be switched off with make incheck
	FULLDOC=no.
	+ (Make.include) Change introduced in 1.394 caused a few libraries
	not to take the value of EXTERNALS into account. This caused
	linking of tasks against those libraries to fail on platforms
	other than Mac OS X. Fixed.
	
Version 1.395 - 2003-05-30 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure) Make the linker shut up on Mac OS X when an
	undefined symbol is found when creating a library.
	
Version 1.394 - 2003-05-29 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in, configure.in) Introduce LIBS_LDLIBS, flags to
	be used when creating shared libraries. Normally this is the same
	as LDLIBS (used to create executables), but on Mac OS X the two
	linking processes must be different. Also, get rid of -m on Mac OS
	X when creating executables.

Version 1.393 - 2003-05-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) Get rid of another occurrence of == in a shell
	test, that would make the incremental build stop in an environment
	with a plain Bourne shell.

Version 1.392 - 2003-05-25 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) The optimization levels are now set by
	configure instead of being hard-coded.
	+ (configure.in) Set optimization levels, so that c++ and f9x
	levels can be set independently based on the OS. On Mac OS f9x
	on slatec triggers a bug in gcc if complied with -O2: set to -O4.
	+ (configure.in) Add -fno-coalesce-templates to c++ flags when
	compiling on Mac OS X, or the CAL Glue does not create a shared
	library. This should possibly be fixed in the CAL.
	
Version 1.391 - 2003-05-24 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) Was not passing -m when creating shared libraries
	on Mac OS X.

Version 1.390 - 2003-05-23 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) remove two occurrences of test x == y (== -> =)
	because that syntax does not work on classic Bourne shells.
	+ (configure.in) fix the selection of the shared library options
	on Mac OS X, where the algorithm used to select whether f95 runs
	with gcc fails because there gcc is called cc.

Version 1.389 - 2003-05-22 (GV)
-------------
	+ Another small tweak for Mac OS X: -fPIC was not being passed
	consistently to the compiler. Also, ask the linker to only warn of
	undefined symbols (-flat_namespace -undefined warning) instead of
	terminating with an error.
	+ (sas-setup.[c]sh) updated DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (Mac OS X).

Version 1.388 - 2003-05-21 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in, Make.include.in) Move some of the choices about
	f90 and f77 from Make.include to configure. Promote Mac OS X to
	supported system, and finalize flags needed to create shared
	libraries on that system.

Version 1.387 - 2003-05-21 (GV)
-------------
	+ (chkdist) permission check was too zealous.
	
Version 1.386 - 2003-05-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ More of the same permission nonsense.

Version 1.385 - 2003-05-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include,in) F90INCFLAGS was lower case.
	+ (chkdist) fix check for file permissions, that was not being
	executed correctly (not all the time any way).
	
Version 1.384 - 2003-05-07 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) if param is in USEDLIBS, also add the
	dal. This may help static build on Mac.

Version 1.383 - 2003-05-07 (GV)
-------------
	+ (SasServer.pm) fix error that prevented download of master MD5.
	+ (ftpsas) fix error when comparing signatures from the MD5 master
	file.
	
Version 1.382 - 2003-05-05 (GV)
-------------
	+ Re-upload of 1.381 when I had uploaded all of the bin/* scripts
	with restrictive permissions.
	
Version 1.381 - 2003-05-01 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure) can make use of libf96.so if a handcrafted
	libf96fix.a containing quickfit.o is also found. 
	
Version 1.380 - 2003-04-29 (GV)
-------------
	+ (chkdist) had become too strict, checking for the file
	build_log, but this file exists during a build and is created
	before the chkdist is run => chkdist always failed during build.

Version 1.379 - 2003-04-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) make sure that build_log_second is removed in
	a make clobber.

Version 1.378 - 2003-04-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ Create and upload packagedetails.html.
	
Version 1.377 - 2003-04-25 (GV)
-------------
	+ Re-upload of 1.376 to test package server in Vilspa.

Version 1.376 - 2003-04-25 (GV)
-------------
	+ Re-upload of 1.375 to test package server in Vilspa.

Version 1.375 - 2003-04-25 (GV)
-------------
	+ (htmkReport) make sure colors also work for short build.
	
Version 1.374 - 2003-04-24 (GV)
-------------
	+ (htmlReport) fix broken links, restructure table for clarity.
	
Version 1.373 - 2003-04-23 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure) fix wrong test syntax (introduced at 1.371) that
	prevented configure from going through on most machines.
	
Version 1.372 - 2003-04-22 (GV)
-------------
	+ (uploadreport) make sure the files build_log_second are uploaded
	if they exist.
	+ (htmlReport) link to build_log_second if necessary; add color
	scheme legenda; adjust colors.
	
Version 1.371 - 2003-04-21 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) make use of libf96.so if a library called libf96fix
	containing the NAG quickfit.o is found. This is necessary on
	recent versions of RedHat (and presumably of other GNU/Linux
	distributions) to prevent linking errors due to the fact that the
	loading of old static libraries may fail.

Version 1.370 - 2003-04-10 (GV)
-------------
	+ (sas-setup.sh) remove incorrect setting of LIBRARY_PATH
	+ (testconfiguremake) source with '. ./sas-setup.sh' to avoid
	failure when PATH does not contain '.'.
	
Version 1.369 - 2003-03-31 (GV)
-------------
	+ (uploadreport) Upload via intermediate tar file. Upload to
	Vilspa machine.

Version 1.368 - 2003-03-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (uploadsas) uploads to Vilspa server. SasServer.pm updated to
	provide interface to upload files.
	
Version 1.367 - 2003-03-20 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) additional Qt-related flags necessary on Mac OS X
	were lost in transit. 

Version 1.366 - 2003-03-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) additional Qt-related flags necessary on Mac OS X
	were lost in transit. 

Version 1.365 - 2003-03-01 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) Some commands are now chattier.
	+ (configure) add -I to Qt include.
	
Version 1.364 - 2003-02-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) All grep statements that have to do with buildlog
	redirect their output to /dev/null. They used to append to the log
	their were grepping, creating the possibility of infinite loops
	(this was sure the case on Mac OS X).

Version 1.363 - 2003-02-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) if USEDLIBS contains param, then force EXTERNALS
	= qt so that the static build works. Set MAKEFLAGS so that the
	directory names are not printed out. Fix for echo -n on Dec.
	make check was no longer creating the html doc,
	fixed. SOC-SPR-2411.
	Add echo command to the end of the target check/incheck/build, so
	that build report does not show a long list of 'make[4]' entries.
	+ (configure) On Mac OS X when using Qt -framework Security is
	also needed in the linker flags.
	
Version 1.362 - 2003-02-21 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) Fix possible race condition while accessing
	the build_log file for the second test, which could lead to an
	infinite recursion while executing the second test harness.

Version 1.361 - 2003-02-21 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure) On Mac OS X switch off optimization.
	
Version 1.360 - 2003-02-20 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure) now add the variables ECHO_N and ECHO_C to Make.include.
	+ (Make.include) Use ECHO_N and ECHO_C to build a supposedly
	platform-independent echo -n. Introduce GNU Make functions to
	simplify the description of the targets check, incheck,
	build. Make sure that if some of the directories where
	Make.include wants to put symbolic links do not exist, an error is
	generated. Add target required_dirs to create all the required
	directories. This is not run automatically to prevent the creation
	of these directories when this is not wanted.
	
Version 1.359 - 2003-02-18 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) Add missing space in rule to create libraries.

Version 1.358 - 2003-02-17 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) When on a Mac OS X switch shared libraries off.
	+ (Make.include.in) Use echo -n when a newline character doesn't
	need to be generated, as this is more portable (to the Mac in
	particular). Add rules to run ranlib on static libraries, as this
	is required on a Mac.
	+ (sas-setup) create ~/.sas.d/config
	
Version 1.357 - 2003-02-07 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) perl tasks depend explicitly on main.pl in
	taskmain and on their own task.pl.
	
Version 1.356 - 2003-01-31 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) implement perl tasks as plain perl scripts.
	+ (configure.in) primitive support for Mac OS X.
	+ (Make.include) primitive support for Max OS X: mkae suffix for
	shared library configurable via configure.
	
Version 1.355 - 2003-01-22 (GV)
-------------
	+ (testconfiguremake) really fix SOC-SPR-2395.
	+ (configure.in):
	  - skip some tests is -enable-strict=no
	  - error/warning if ds9 is version 2.2.1
	  - only support f95
	  - Qt >= 2.3.2
	
Version 1.354 - 2003-01-21
-------------
	+ (Make.include) incremental build runs again the test harnesses.

Version 1.353 - 2003-01-10
-------------
        + (sas.bib) fix typo on CALHB entry ct:calhb, update URLs for
         Chandra documents (region, data model etc.)
	+ (testconfiguremake) use gmake instead of make if
	found. SOC-SPR-2395.	
	
Version 1.352 - 2003-01-06 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/uploadreport) force ftp to run in passive mode, so it works
	from behind some firewalls.

Version 1.351 - 2003-01-03 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) The fix at 1.348 was preventing the task
	binaries from being removed (I should have used %\/ instead of %/
	in the clean and clobber rules). SOC-SPR-2393.
	+ (configure.in) check that tsort is available. SOC-SPR-2378.
	
Version 1.350 - 2002-12-23 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) run f90depend with LANG=C set, ot on RH8.0 not
	all modules are correctly found.
	
Version 1.349 - 2002-12-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ (sas.bib) How many tries to get a reference right?? Fix typo in
	URL for CALHB.

Version 1.348 - 2002-12-18 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (bin/sasclean_cpath) 'sh' does not know about '==' operator
	+ (Make.include.in) Forgot a trailing '/' in using addprefix(). This
	  triggered mayhap on the backward directory.

Version 1.347 - 2002-12-18 (GV)
-------------
	+ (sas.bib) Add missing space between \tt and text.

Version 1.346 - 2002-12-17 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (configure.in,sas.environment.in,Make.include.in) Using CPATH:
	  'make' as well as 'configure' will check and modify environment
	  if necessary.
	  We do it in both systems, as a 'developer' may want to force
	  different environment setting, than the one that was used during
	  configuration...
	+ (bin/sasclean_cpath) added to do the above in 'configure' as well
	  as in 'make'
	
Version 1.345 - 2002-12-17 (GV)
-------------
	+ (sas.bib) update URL for CAL HB.
	+ (testconfiguremake) change exports to be portable (SOC-SPR-2384).
	
Version 1.344 - 2002-12-16 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) Restore name of CONFIGDIR that had been
	removed. This triggered a number of failures on make depend.
	+ (Make.include.in) A build with a stricter behavior of the c++
	compiler can be achiver by specifying STRICTCPP=yes. By default
	this is set to no, or the build explodes :)
	+ (Make.include.in) Make running the test harnesses during an
	incremental build conditional (RUNTESTS=yes).
	+ Add PNG versions of all icons needed by latex2html.
	
Version 1.343 - 2002-12-14 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) name of directory below is include.

Version 1.342 - 2002-12-14 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) re-introduce usage of config-std.h as this adds
          using namespace std, and this is very much needed at this
	  stage. However, this file is not generated by configure (which
	  would trigger a rebuild in an incremental build) but just places
	  in $SAS_DIR/config and included from there, so that a new build
	  is only required when that file changes.  

Version 1.341 - 2002-12-13 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) remove usage of config-std.h.

Version 1.340 - 2002-12-13 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) replace using [] with test in file tests as this
	is more portable.
	+ (SasVersion.h) define more strings (like AKA).
	+ (configure.in) remove creation of config-std.h.in as code is
	  supposed to work with gcc-3.x now. Also, the creation of this file
	  each time triggered a complete rebuild during incrementals.
	+ (ftpsas) additional exit code when running in patch mode to
          indicate that that package sas was updated and configure needs
	  to be run again.

Version 1.339 - 2002-12-12 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) identify RedHat and SuSE, make use of RELEASE file.
	+ (SasVersion.h.in) add RELEASE constant.

Version 1.338 - 2002-12-10 (GV)
-------------
        + (bin/createcompletionscripts) remove -s flag when creating bash file.
	+ (configure) for gcc 3.2 we need to re-introduce the work around
	concerning the way headers found in CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH are treated
	(they are considered to be C headers even if they are C++). This
	leads to warnings in the build.

Version 1.337 - 2002-12-09 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Makefile.top) at end of make check creates shell command line
          completion scripts in SAS_DIR.

Version 1.336 - 2002-12-05  (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) change lack of GNU ar into a warning (it was an
	error).

Version 1.335 - 2002-12-05  (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) targets clobber and clean remove the finale /
	from CLOBBERFILES and CLEANFILES, or rm will fail for symlinks on
	RedHat 8.0.
	
Version 1.334 - 2002-12-05 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) more support for CVS (make branch).

Version 1.333 - 2002-12-04 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) additional CVS markers had entered the file,
          breaking it.
	+ (testconfiguremake) a new test harness where a mini SAS build of
	one package is attempted. This to ensure that changes to configure
	and Make.include are not deadly.
	  
Version 1.332 - 2002-12-03 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/Makefile) had forgotten to add htmlReport to DEVSCRIPTS.

Version 1.331 - 2002-12-02 (GV)
-------------
	+ (htmlReport) subsumes incheckReport, checkReport,
	buildReport. Re-work the color coding algorithm so that it can 
	cope with incremental builds where no test harnesses are run at
	all. All html report in Make.include are generated with this script.
	
Version 1.330 - 2002-11-28 (GV)
-------------	
	+ (Make.include) incheck does not run the test harnesses
	now. Temporary change to allow people to decide where the time for
	an incremental build goes.
	
Version 1.329 - 2002-11-22 (GV)
-------------
	+ (f90depend) make it work on RedHat 8.0 (SOC-SPR-2368).

Version 1.328 - 2002-11-21 (GV)
-------------
	+ (ftpsas) preserve exit status in END block, otherwise it is
	always reset to 0 because the END block is guaranteed to succeed.
	+ (Makefile.top) do not echo the uploadreport command.
	
Version 1.327 - 2002-11-11 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) More tweaks to compiler flags when profiling.

Version 1.326 - 2002-11-11 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) When PROFILE is on, make sure the debug flags are
	correctly set.
	
Version 1.325 - 2002-10-31 (GV)
-------------
	+ (ftpsas) allow one to specify a name other than 'make' for GNU
	Make. Add more protection to chdir/mkdir statements to prevent
	ftpsas from unpacking packages in the wrong directory. 

Version 1.324 - 2002-10-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) make incheck now only builds the ps
	documentation, so as to speed it up even further (while I figure
	out a way to introduce a reliable dependency mechanism for
	latex2html). Add a rudimentary dependency mechanism to create the
	ps documentation, so that the latter is not re-built unless the
	latex source (or some of the auxiliary files in packages sas) have
	changed. This is not fool proof, but should significantly improve
	the speed of incremental builds.
	

Version 1.323 - 2002-10-14 (GV)
-------------
	+ (sasglobal.tex) \task{} macro generates bold text in ps doc (SOC-SPR-2318)

Version 1.322 - 2002-10-03 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/uploadreport) make silent so cron jobs don't talk. Also
	check exit status after ech ftp call, so cron jobs will talk when
	an error.

Version 1.321 - 2002-09-27 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/fixdoc) write final new line to sasdoc_version.tex.

Version 1.320 - 2002-09-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/chkdist) introduce a @relaxed@ checking mode so that
	incremental builds can run this test as well.
	+ (Make.include) modify the incheck target so that chkdist is run
	in relaxed mode.
	+ (bin/incheckReport) updated with the extra column in the build
	report.

Version 1.319 - 2002-09-24 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/runtestalarm.cc) allow one to set the maximum allowed
	duration of a single test harness run via the environment variable
	SAS_TEST_TIMEOUT. 

Version 1.318 - 2002-09-24 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) additional fix for gcc 2.96 (early version found
	on RH 7.1) whereby vthe environment variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH is
	ignored.

Version 1.317 - 2002-09-20 (GV)
-------------
	+ (ftpsas, SasServer.pm) small updates to log/error messages and
	documentation to clarify what is happening.


Version 1.316 - 2002-09-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ (chkdist) package sas in DEPEND: restored for the DT.

Version 1.315.1 - 2002-09-19 (GV)
---------------
	+ (chkdist) does not require that package sas be in DEPEND file,
	as this check is too strict in current RT.

Version 1.315 - 2002-09-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) accept Qt version 3 instead of stopping. Change
	use of tr when checking for ftools version to eliminate warning
	message in linux.
	
Version 1.314 - 2002-09-17 (GV)
-------------
	+ added backward-gcc2/streambuf
	+ Make.include: make it possible to upload package sas with make upload.
	
Version 1.313 - 2002-09-12 (JBa)
-------------
	+ added backward-gcc2/istream

Version 1.312 - 2002-09-01 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) implement INTERNALS correctly (it was referencing
	EXTERNALS). 


Version 1.311 - 2002-08-29 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/ftpsas) split one line in two as suggested in SOC-SPR-2333.
	+ (bin/ftpsas) when --patch is given (incremental builds) before a
	package can be unpacked the following is done:
	   . cd package-directory and make clobber
	   . rm -fr package-directory
	

Version 1.310 - 2002-08-01 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/ftpsas) supply 0777 mask to all mkdir calls, as the mask is
	mandatory in perl 5.005. Also, detect which of MD5 or Digest::MD5
	is present and use it. (The perl modules MD5 has been removed
	Digest::Md5, with exactly the same interface and functionality.)
	+ Pod::Usage.pm: define $progpath to be simply perldoc, so that it
	works even when perldoc is not in the same bin directory as perl
	itself. 

	
Version 1.309 - 2002-07-29 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) die if ds9 not >= 2.0.
	
Version 1.308 - 2002-07-29 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) Missing '/' in fix made in previous version.
	
Version 1.307 - 2002-07-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) If the gcc backward compatibility directory is
	needed, takes it via -I$(SAS_DIR)/include and not $(INCDIR), or
	compilation of c++ packages that need it will fail when those
	packages are built in a subdirectory of SAS_PATH (SOC-SPR-2331).
	+ (Make.include) Add directive PERLDIRS for subdirectories that
	should be linked directly under lib/perl5, so that external
	modules can be easily available to all scripts. Add PERLMODS
	directive for individual modules.
	+ Move SasServer to lib, and make it a PERLMODS.
	+ Add Pod::Usage as a PERLDIRS so that ftpsas works also with perl
	  5.005 without installation of additional modules.


Version 1.306 - 2002-07-18 (GV)
-------------
	+ (sas.bib) add entries for DS9 and GAIA, as per ims request.
	
Version 1.305 - 2002-07-18 (GV)
-------------
	+ ftpsas had been left in package devel. Moved here.
	+ (in)checkReport: change the color coding.
	
Version 1.304 - 2002-07-12 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/Makefile) I had left out uploadreport from DEVSCRIPTS.
	+ (bin/checkReport) change colors.

Version 1.303 - 2002-07-11 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) add targets distcheck and depcheck, so that it is
	possible to run these checks independently.
	+ (bin) add all of the scripts that were in package devel, so that
	the latter can easily be taken out of the manifest when a public
	binary is built.

Version 1.302 - 2002-07-09 (GV)
-------------
	+ (chkdist) make it an error not to DEPEND at least on package
	sas.
	+ (chkdist) make it an error not to have a ChangeLog entry
	matching the version number. Also, the matching entry must be the
	first one in the file.
	+ (chkdist) make it an error not to have a GROUPS entry in the
	task.info file.
	+ (Make.include.in) expand the range of targets executed in a make
	incheck and make update. Preparation for incremental builds.
	+ (configure.in) switching sharedversion on forces shared to be on
	as well.
	+ Change the maximum single test harness duration to 600s. Change
	implementation of the timeout cndition to use system instead of
	exec, so the alarm signal can be trapped.
	+ incheckReport: added to report on incremental builds.
	
Version 1.301 - 2002-07-08 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include) run test harnesses through runtestwrap. This sets
	the maximum CPU time per test harness to 1000s, then runs the test
	harness through runtestalarm, where the maximum wall clock time
	per test harness is agains et to 1000s. This to prevent problems
	with hanging test harnesses, or test harnesses that enter an
	infinite loop.
	+ (bin/runtestwrap) added
	+ (src/runtestalarm.cc) added
	
Version 1.300 - 2002-06-27 (JBa)
-------------
	+ Preparation for GCC 3.1
	  Added backward compatibility directory for GCC-2.9x

Version 1.299 - 2002-06-27 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (test/check_dev_bins_scripts) make sure it works if current
	  directory is not in PATH
	
Version 1.297 - 2002-06-11 (JBa)
-------------
	+ As the HTML documentation, the PostScript documentation now also
	  contains a Parameter header. (SOC::SPR 2323)
	
Version 1.296 - 2002-06-10 (GV)
-------------
	+ configure now works with the latest autoconf (now required).
	
Version 1.295 - 2002-05-13 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) make sure all tasks are getting selectlib on the link line.
	
Version 1.294 - 2002-05-07 (GV)
-------------
	+ (chkdist) validateParameters is called only for XPI-style files.
	
Version 1.293 - 2002-05-02 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) add selector to USEDLIBS when param is also
	used. This is needed to support param-2.0.
	+ (Make.include.in) add DEVTASKS directive.
	+ (Make.include.in) $(TASKHEADIMPS) are removed on the clobber and
	not on the clean, so incremental builds can work. Also, all the
	autogenerated code is now dependent on some of the source files in
	package taskmain, so that it is re-created only if taskmain has
	been updated.
	
Version 1.292 - 2002-04-29 (GV)
-------------	
	+ (Makefile.top) adjust target binary_exclude to exclude files in
	bin/devel, lib/data/tmp, and lib/data
	+ (configure.in) checks for mysql lib/header, set HAVE_MYSQL if
	ok. Also check for some of the CERN libraries.
	+ (acconfig.h) updated.
	+ (Make.include.in) add ODFDIRS for symlinks under lib/testodf.
	+ (Make.include.in) all tests now run with stdin from /dev/null,
	so that running some ftools will not hang the build.
	+ (chkdist) issue warning if no ChangeLog entry for VERSION is found.
	
Version 1.291 - 2002-04-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) change a couuple of SAS_DIR/bin to SASBIN,
	as the former no longer contains the development scripts required
	for the build.

Version 1.290 - 2002-04-27 (GV)
-------------
	+ (bin/Makefile) fix DEVSCRIPTS (was mispelled).
	+ (Make.include.in) re-introduce changes made at 1.288 that had gone missing.
 	+ (test) add test harnesses for DEVSCRIPTS and DEVBINS targets

Version 1.289 - 2002-04-26 (GV)
-------------

        bin/devel).
        + (Makefile.top) new target uploadreport
        + (Make.include.in) add target updateparfile for transition to
        param-2.0.
        + (Make.include.in) introduce DEVSCRIPTS and DEVBINS, similar to
        their DEV-less namesakes but to be linked under
        SAS_DIR/bin/devel. sas-setup.[c]sh adjusted so that
        SAS_DIR/bin/devel is in the PATH.
	+ (bin/Makefile) change SCRIPTS to DEVSCRIPTS
        + (uploadreport) issue error if it cannot ftp to SOC server,
        instead of dying with an undefined variable.
        + (Make.include.in) introduce DATADIRS target for directories that
        are linked under lib/data

Version 1.287.26 - 2002-04-26 (GV)
----------------
	+ (configure.in) adjust an already existing test that about the
	need to add the option -E to the GNU linker. The test used to be
	triggered only when the existing perl had been compiled with gcc
	2.8.1, but the solution is applicable to a more general
	case. SOC-SPR-2299. 
	
Version 1.287.25 - 2002-04-13 (GV)
----------------
	+ Re-upload.

Version 1.287.24 - 2002-04-13 (GV)

Version 1.287.23 - 2002-04-13 (GV)
----------------
	+ (Makefile.top) change == to = in one of the test conditions.

	+ (configure.in) by default version numbers in shared libraries is off again.
	+ (Makefile.top) do not do a clean_binary when the binary
	distribution is made, so that the SAS tree can be used to compile
	against after a binary is made.
	
Version 1.287.22 - 2002-04-13 (GV)
----------------
	+ (Makefile.top) make clean_binary before creating the binary
	distributions.

----------------
	+ (Makefile.top) if lib....so.n exist do not dump lib...so in the binary.

Version 1.287.20 - 2002-04-09 (JBa)
----------------
	+ (doc/lib/sasref.perl)
	Implementated a hyperlink from the 'type' of a parameter to the
	parameter documentation.

Version 1.287.19 - 2002-04-09 (GV)
----------------
	+ (Makefile.top) introduce the variables TAR and FIND, so that it
	becomes possible to do make binary-target TAR=gtar etc, should GNU
	tar have a different name. Eventually this should be detected by
	configure.

Version 1.287.18 - 2002-04-09 (GV)
----------------

	+ (Makefile.top) add target to make libsys subdir and tar ball.

Version 1.287.15 - 2002-04-04 (GV)
----------------
	+ sas-setup.sh: change a couple of 'if ! test ...' in 'if test ! ...'
	  as the former does not seem to work with some sh flavors.

-------------
	+ (Make.include.in/configure/configure.in/config-std.h.in)
	  Adopted necessary changes to the infrastructure setup in order to
	  compile with GCC 3. Changes include:
	  * added 'using standard namespace' as a temporary fix. This is
	    done in 'config-std.h' and included in Make.include with an
	    '-include <file>' statement
	  * a workaround for bug in GCC 3.0.1 (GNATS pr=4256). All headers

        + This fix has also been made to the release track.

Version 1.264 - 2001-08-17 (JBa)
-------------
	+ created new make rule:'make infokey'. By default it dumps the
	  values of all compiler flags, but you can specify any make variable:

Version 1.259.4 - 2001-05-23 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.perl.in)
	  * Fixed creation of dynamic perl modules
	  * Improved target dependency. targets are created only once

Version 1.259.2 - 2001-05-21 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.perl.in)
	  Removed hardcoding of linker-flags. Using flags as determined by
	  configure.

Version 1.259.1 - 2001-05-15 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) make GNUPERLLDFLAGS available in debug mode too

Version 1.259 - 2001-05-08 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) Added dynamic link library (dl) to the system

	+ (Make.include.in) Changes in compiler FLAGS
	  * Usage of '-imacros FILE' option instead of endless
	    macro definitions

	  flags
	+ (config.h.in,acconfig.h) Former generated from latter && configure.in

Version 1.258 - 2001-05-01 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) Added math library (m) to the system libraries again
	  somehow, the need for this library depends on the order of library
	  directories in $LIBRARY_PATH?

Version 1.257 - 2001-04-27 (JBa)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in configure.in) made the shared and binary linking
	  stage *very* fast on solaris

Version 1.256 - 2001-04-23 (GV)
-------------
	+ (Make.include.in) remove -ggdb from CXX debug options as it does
	not bring any benefit (contrary to what advertized).
	+ (Make.include.in) add target incheck: as check but doc is ps
	only, object files are left in place to allow one to make
	incremental builds. 
	
Version 1.255 - 2001-04-19 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) yet another tweak to the pgplot/g2c logic to work
	around autoconf's cache. Also there are more pgplot/g2c/gcc
	combinations out there ...
	
Version 1.254 - 2001-04-17 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) modify again the logic required to detect whether
	pgplot is compiled with g77 and so it needs libg2c.
	+ (Make.include.in) -lg2c is on the command line only when
	EXTERNALS = pgplot is specified.

Version 1.253 - 2001-04-12 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) f90 test does not try to do asin(10), as it fails
	miserably on dec ;-)
	
Version 1.252 - 2001-04-09 (GV)
-------------
	+ (configure.in) modify the way the f90 link test is done, as it
	did not always work (at least in one case). Now the linking is

Version 1.126 - 1999-05-17 (GV)
-------------
	+ latex doc commands store their output to a temporay file that is

	only to stdout.
	
Version 1.125 - 1999-05-07 (GV)
-------------
	+ bibtex command must be run with -, so make will ignore its error
	status (which is 2 when non citation commands are found).

- updated latex2html-init file (MB)

Version 1.102 1999-03-24 (GV)
-------------
- changed the handling of the EXTERNALS = pgplot in Make.include. The use

------------
- fixed libtominl (wrong when library name contains 'lib', e.g. saslib)

Version 1.93 1999-03-05 (MB)
------------
- modified the make procedure so that no absolute path to the shared libraries
  is put into the executables.

Version 1.92 1999-03-04 (MB)
------------
- Make.depends is now created such that the dependency on the libraries
  is generated dynamically; this ensures that we link against the shared lib
  and that an executable is regenerated when the lib is updated.
- fix make prepare for testodf (links.here depends on make_dirs)

Version 1.91 1999-03-02 (MB)
------------

------------
- support for f77 (MB)

Version 1.81
------------
- re-added link to task directory in $TOP_DIR/include (MB)

Version 1.80
------------
- libraries and executables are now built from all the files
  that they depend upon. This allows to add wrappers for task subroutines so
  that they can be accessed from all languages. This also simplifies the
  Make.include, which is never a bad thing. (MB)

Version 1.79
------------

- no link was generated to the task libraries (MB)

Version 1.78

Version 1.75 (GV)
------------
 	- by default the build is without -g. Use: make <target> DEBUG=yes
	will compile with debugging information.
	- new EXTERNALS: xmgr and qt
	- configure is considerably more quiet about what it does not
	find. It shouts only if something is missing that would prevent
	the core sas from building correctly.
	
Version 1.74
------------
 - Make.include.in: define variables $(USE_CAL)/$(USE_OAL) which are
   either empty or set to "-DUSE_CAL"/"-DUSE_OAL" depending on
   whether the task uses Cal/Oal ($(USEDLIBS) is inspected for that) -
   needed for conditional comilation of CAL/OAL specific code in main.cc (UL)

 - added constructManifest, which will check whether the result of
   make check was sufficient and produces a manifest file of the packages
   that succeeded. (MB)

Version 1.63 (GV)
------------

 - there was another error in the logic supporting Perl tasks.

Version 1.62 (GV)
------------

 - record that -u is now added to the Fortran flags.

Version 1.61 (GV)
------------

 - fix variable typo.

Version 1.60 (GV)
------------

 - remake configure. This should be a special rule in the make file?

Version 1.59 (GV)
------------

	- modify rules for Perl targets so that Make.include changes do
	not affect taskmain 
	- configure warns about SAOTNG, xmgr, and scisim not being found.

Version 1.58 (GV)
------------

 - add COMBILIBS to LINKS
 - fix typo in yacc rules

Version 1.57
------------

 - add support for lex/yacc.

Version 1.56
------------

 - fix Perl-related rules that were sending make into a loop. (GV)
	
Version 1.55
------------

 - Added script saslocate. (MB)
 - checkReport now requires the input file as argument. (MB)
 - change target names for EXTERNAL and PERL to make consistent
   with others. (GV)

Version 1.54
------------

 - fix f90depend that could not cope with -ccarg flags
 - Make.include now tests for SHARED=yes, not just defined.

Version 1.53
------------

 - add Make.include.perl here, instead of replicating it everywhere.

Version 1.52
------------

 - Fixed SPR-22:  f90depend should produce dependencies to .mod, not .o (JB)
 - Fixed reporting Build succeeded and failed at the same time (MB)

Version 1.51
------------

 - solved 'make check fails on missing check.txt' (MB)

Version 1.50
------------

 - added -u (enforce implicit none) to F90 flags. (MB)
 - added support for PERL, EMBED_PERL changed into EXTERNAL = perl

Version 1.48 (MB)
------------

 - fixed sas-setup.csh.in

Version 1.47 (MB)
------------

 - fixed wrong quote.

Version 1.46 (GV)
------------

 - introduce support for shared libraries. Compile with make SHARED=yes
   sas-setup modified to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (GV)

 - f95 is the preferred compiler now. Use configure --enable-nagware to
   go back to f90. (GV)

 - now deletes <task>.tex (fixes SPR422). (MB)

 - make check produces check.txt and check.html; make or make all
   produces build.txt and build.html. (MB)

Version 1.45 (MB)
------------

 - make is now a package-by-package build from scratch, which produces the
   build HTML table in integration.html and exits with status != 0 in case of an
   error. make check is no longer required; just use make. To compile the
   binaries only, do make bin.
 - No longer does make doc twice, since there are hardly any external references
 - Made available checkReport.

Version 1.44 (MB)
------------

 - Fixed .ref confusion.
 - Added loggin of time to make check.

Version 1.43 (MB)
------------

 - Simplified and improved make all and make check.

Version 1.42 (MB)
------------

 - keep the -g flag for the moment, since gcc 2.7.2.3 on Solaris cannot compile
   the SAS without -g.

Version 1.41 (GV)
------------

	+ to help with the integration of Perl modules, the configure
	script identifies the name Perl gives to the architecture. This is
	used to modify the PERLLIB variables in sas-set.

	
Version 1.40 (GV)
------------

  - PATH is recoded in sas.environment.

Version 1.39 (MB)
------------

  - lib/perl is no longer made by Makefile.top, since both lib and lib/perl
    in MKDIRS gives a race condition with a parallel make.

Version 1.38 (GV)
------------

   - sas-setup now defines POW_LIBRARY. This closes SPR 467.
	
Version 1.37 (GV)
------------

   - SPRs (mostly already closed):
     +   101 : Documentation of external packages not integrated
     +   228 : make depend crashes (rejected)
     +   99 : Trailing space in MKDIRS gives error (rejected)

   - configure: 
     + tentative support for f95. Not tested.
     + environment found by configure recorded in sas.environment
     + Perl incs/libs not in default INCS/LIBS (reduce external dependencies of core)
     + do not check for pquery2 (FTOOLS) as this is no longer needed by the CAL
     + warn if QTDIR not set

   - Make.include:
     + tentative support for f95. Not tested.
     + strip executables, do not compile with debugging symbols by default. Use make DEBUG=yes instead.
     + use make EMBED_PERL=yes to use Perl libs/incs.
	
Version 1.36 (GV)
------------

  - forgot to run autoconf, so the previous release was the same as 1.34.

Version 1.35 (GV)
------------

  - and an extra -lm when compiling with nagace. This is an empirical solution.
    This should close SPR 453.
	
Version 1.34 (GV)
------------

  - fix >< problem in instal..html.

Version 1.33 (GV)
------------

 - updated the installation instructions.

Version 1.32 (MB)
------------

   exists in lib/perl

Version 1.31 (MB)
------------

Version 1.30 (MB)
------------

 - added checkReport script.
 - checked make depend logic, so that it now works with parallel make
 
Version 1.29 (MB)
------------ 

 - do final linking with c++, not cc, since the main program is C++;
   also solves version conflicts between cc and c++.

Version 1.28 (MB)
------------

 - added empty test harness.

Version 1.27 (GV)
------------

 - replace grep -e in Make.include with a simple grep, as the -e is not
   supported by every grep.
	
Version 1.26 (GV)
------------

 - modify grep expressions in Make.include to make them more unambiguous.
	
Version 1.25 (GV)
------------

 - close SPR 411

Version 1.22
------------

 - fixed bug in sas.bib (missing comma)
 - added bibliography to package toplevel document (package.tex)
 - tasks are also turned into a library
 - create link from config directory to the .par as well

Version 1.21
------------

 - removed check for Make.depends for targets all and check.

Version 1.20
------------

 - added extra targets to the file existance checks at the end of Make.include.
 - added lib/perl to MKDIRS in Makefile.top

Version 1.19
------------

Version 1.18
------------

   $SAS_DIR/lib/perl
	
Version 1.16
------------

 - make test exits with error status != 0 if a test fails
 - changed name of verify into check
 - make all will try to build everything package by package

Version 1.15
------------

 - added a target verify that produces a +/- list of successive stages in the
   build.

Version 1.14
------------
	
 - sas-setup scripts correctly prepend SAS_PATH/bin to the path.

Version 1.13
------------

 - LaTeX now no longer waits for input when an error occurs during make doc.

Version 1.12
------------

 - now doc generates the toplevel LaTeX document; enforces compliant
   documentation.

Version 1.11
------------

 - temporarily allows non-compliant documentation.

Version 1.10
------------

 - make doc now generates the toplevel LaTeX document itself, so it is no longer
   needed in the packages. The uniform toplevel document ensures that the
   documents can also be integrated in another toplevel document, e.g. with
   all package documents as a chapter in a single document.

 - added a list of standard LaTeX packages to sasbook and the toplevel
   LaTeX template (package.tex).

 - added an installation instruction for latex2html to solve a conflict with
   verbatim.sty.

 - Added a script sasbook and LaTeX style sasbook.cls that can be used to
   produce a SAS printed manual.

 - Makefile.top is changed such that the package overview is always produced
   when doing make doc.

 - improved overview script; it now scans SAS_PATH.

 - Make.include now supports C++ tasks.

Version 1.2 - 28-05-98
-----------
