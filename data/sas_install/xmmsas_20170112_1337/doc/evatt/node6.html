<UL>
<LI><A NAME="460"></A><TT>CLOSE_TO_CCD_BORDER</TT> This event was immediately next to a
  border of the CCD, so that part of its charge may have been lost.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="462"></A><TT>CLOSE_TO_CCD_WINDOW</TT> This event was immediately next to a
  border of the current CCD window (when not in full frame mode), so
  that part of its charge may have been lost. For EPIC/MOS only events
  next to the left and lower borders are affected and flagged.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="464"></A><TT>CLOSE_TO_ONBOARD_BADPIX</TT> This event was immediately next
  (to the left, right, above or below but not diagonally) to a bad
  pixel declared on board. Its energy will be imprecise, but since
  this may happen only when the bad pixel is inactive it should be a
  true X-ray.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="466"></A><TT>CLOSE_TO_BRIGHTPIX</TT> This event was immediately next (to the
  left, right, above or below but not diagonally) to a bright pixel
  not declared on board. Its energy will be imprecise, and it could be
  a false event if the bright pixel next to it was active.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="468"></A><TT>CLOSE_TO_DEADPIX</TT> This event was immediately next (to the
  left, right, above or below but not diagonally) to a dead pixel, so
  that part of its charge may have been lost.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="470"></A><TT>NEXT_TO_OFFSETCOL</TT> This event was immediately next to a
  column that has a higher lower threshold than the rest of the CCD.
  Part of its charge may have been lost.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="472"></A><TT>ON_OFFSETCOL</TT> This event was immediately on a column that
  has a higher lower threshold than the rest of the CCD. Part of its
  charge may have been lost.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="474"></A><TT>IN_SPOILED_FRAME</TT> This event was detected in a frame where
  other events were detected in wrong readout order or with illegal
  coordinates.  The information related with this events is not
  reliable.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="476"></A><TT>INVALID_PATTERN</TT> This event is part of a pattern that
cannot be produced by a single photon. It is either caused by
pile-up or is a remnant of charged particle events (MIPs) that
were rejected on-board (or in <TT>epframes</TT> if on-board rejection
was switched off).

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="478"></A><TT>OUT_OF_FOV</TT> This event was detected outside the nominal
  field of view of XMM. It was an out-of-time event recorded during
  CCD readout or due to internal noise.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="480"></A><TT>FLICKERING</TT> This event is due to a flickering pixel.
