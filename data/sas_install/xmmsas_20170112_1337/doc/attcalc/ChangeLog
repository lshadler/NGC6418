ChangeLog for attcalc
===============================
Open SPRs:
- none

Version 4.37 - 2016-09-06 (AI)
---------------------------------
	- (src/attcalc_mod.f90) Initialization to null of all pointers that are passed 
	to C++ (Dope vectors). If we do not initizialize the pointers, 
	we get seg fault at run-time with gcc-6.2.	

Version 4.36 - 2016-07-20 (AI)
---------------------------------
	+ (src/attcalc_mod.f90) compatibility changes with gfortran applied.
	The Bmatrix is passed to C++ with a wrong array descriptor elements (dtype and triplet).
	Only if we create the local variable matrix, we can pass the right values to C++. Not clear 
	why this is happening, we have to keep an eye on it.
	The OAL_toEulerAngles subrotutine has to be called with the matrix transpose. 
	Otherwise, the C++ function handle the matrix elements in the wrong order. We 
	have a similar effect in  rgslib(euler321_mod.f90) module. This problem also appears in
	eexpmap package (the code is duplicated...)
	+ (src/Makefile) gfrotran preprocessor macros added.
	
Version 4.35 - 2016-07-15 (AI)
---------------------------------
	+ (src/attcalc_mod.f90) gfortran compatibilty changes.
	
Version 4.34 - 2015-08-25 (RDS)
---------------------------------
 + (src/attcalc_mod.f90): Changed the use of the psi euler angle such that 
 			  it subtracts rather than adds. This is only valid if
			  the BORESIGHT CCF contains PSI with a changed sign
			  (SCR-7265)

Version 4.33 - 2012-11-14 (RDS)
---------------------------------
 + (src/attcalc_mod.f90): Added keyword, calctlmax, which if set true
			  causes the code to calculate TLMIN and TLMAX
			  independently for X and Y from the actual X,Y event
			  positions.
			           (SPR-6769)

Version 4.32.2 - 2012-05-07 (RDS)
---------------------------------
 + (src/attcalc_mod.f90): Only copy RA_PNT keywords from primary into 
			  events header if they exist.
			           (SPR-6648)

Version 4.32.1 - 2012-05-04 (RDS)
---------------------------------
 + (src/attcalc_mod.f90): Copy REF keywords from pimary into events header.
			           (SPR-6648)

Version 4.32 - 2003-07-14 (RDS)
------------------------------
+ fixed a trivial oversight in 4.31 where memory was being freed
  without being allocated.

Version 4.31 - 2003-07-11 (UL)
------------------------------
+ experimental change :-) attempt to fix a supposed problem about the
  position of the optical axes; the code used to calculate the position
  in DETX/DETY space (CAMCOORD2 in units of 1/20th arcsec) wrongly;
  what was really computed was the position of the *nominal* optical axes
  in the frame centered on the position of the *real* optical axes;
  impact of this change is expected to be minimal because up to and
  including XMM_MISCDATA_0019 the real axis position (attibutes OPTICS_X/Y
  in CHIPCOORD) concided with the nominal ones; for more info search
  for 'cendetx' in code

Version 4.30 - 2003-05-07 (HB)
-------------------------------
 + (config/attcalc.par): modified to enable  param-2.0 functionality	
	
Version 4.29 - 2002-07-15 (MJF)
-------------------------------
 + (DEPEND): added "sas" as required by new infrastructure (sas-1.302)

 + (DEPEND): needs `param-2.0', updated all other entries to latest

Version 4.27.1 - 2002-04-08 (MJF)
---------------------------------
 + (src/attcalc_mod.f90): converted debug output introduced in 4.27 to a
   "Noisy" message [SSC-SPR-2824]
closed SPR:
- SSC-SPR-2824: debug output should be message

- Test harness updated
- Documentation numbering changed

Version 4.14  -  19-11-99
-----------

- Test harness changed - handles new SAS_ODF and SAS_CCF
- DISTRIBUTION file and newline in ./Makefile included 
- DEPENDS on new emsaplib

Version 4.13  -  15-11-99
-----------

- New CAL (3.32) and testccf (1.51) used, incorporating changed boresight 
  handling (CAL_getBoresightMatrix) and camera-to-spacecraft co-ord handling
  (CAL_getCamCoord2ToSacCoord).

Version 4.12  -  05-10-99
-----------

- Three SPRs closed (use of errors, warnings and messages)
- Test harness updated

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-1269, 1273, 1274

Version 4.11  -  24-09-99
-----------

- Task handles completely bad quality atthkgen files correctly. 
- Test harness updated. Handles exit status checking of each subtest programs.

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-1207 

Version 4.10  -  17-09-99
-----------

- NULL settings are now used for X and Y values, in cases of bad attitude data.
  The X/Y TNULL values are -99999999, and `INDEF' appears in the X/Y columns
- Documentation updated to attcalc v4.10. New latex macros used. 
- Test harness updated to include testing of bad attitude/NULL functions.
- Layout file corrected (atthkset file must exist). Closes SPR.
- ChangeCase function accessed via emutils library. Closes SPR.

Closed SPRs : SSC-SPR-0317, 1244
SPRs to be closed, pending outside tests : 1207 

Version 4.9  -  01-09-99
-----------

- Test harness updated. Newly created files used. `Drifting' AHF accessed. 
  Individual detector boresight and orientations tested. 
- Documentation updated, partly as regards use of atthkgen output file
- Several SPRs closed

Closed SPRs : SSC-SPR-1200, 1202, 1204, 1206, 1230
SPRs to be closed, pending outside tests : 1207 

Version 4.8  -  20-08-99
-----------

- As v4.7, with one character in the code changed! 

Version 4.7  -  19-08-99
-----------

- As v4.6, with errors regarding PNT keywords and lo-number event lists 
  corrected for. 
- As regards propogating the PNT keywords, atthkgen must be run before
  attcalc, whatever mode of attcalc is used. 

Version 4.6  -  19-08-99
-----------

- As v4.5, but with slight change in usage of OAL_getAttitude
- Depends on cal-3.16 and oal-3.28

Version 4.5  -  18-08-99
-----------

- Two new (optional) parameters to use when refpointlabel=pnt. Here 
  either (set via "withmedianpnt") the median (default) or mean attitude 
  pointing can be used as the reference point of the sky co-ordinates. 
  This information is here retrieved from the output of the task atthkgen 
  (which will need to have been run previously) via the parameter "atthkset" 
  (default: atthk.dat). 
- Because of above, chains that attempt to run attcalc with refpointlabel=pnt, 
  will need to have run atthkgen first. 
- Attcalc should be able to correctly handle the CAMCOORD2-to-Spacecraft 
  boresight matrices expected soon (cal-3.16). 
- Usage of OAL_getAttitude changed to reflect expected changes in oal (v3.28)
- Documentation and test harness updated. 
- NB `Blind' delivery (DEPEND on oal-3.28)

- Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-1183, 1185, 1186, 1187

Version 4.4  -  12-08-99
-----------

- Use with `drifting' attitude tested. Included in test harness. 
- Small error found when using varying attitude corrected for. 
- Should be complient with new camera orientation information
  provided by CAL/OAL (testccf-1.30). 

Version 4.3  -  06-08-99
-----------

- SPRs SSC-SPR-1127 and 1145 dealt with (also 1157 closed)
- TCUNI WCS attributes now introduced
- No attempts at checking with varying odf `scisimwobble', as this does 
  not yet exist

Version 4.2  -  11-06-99
-----------

- In line with CAL v3.0
- No attempts at checking with varying odf `scisimwobble', as this does 
  not yet exist

Version 4.1  -  28-05-99
-----------

- Bug in transformation fixed - closes SPRs

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0993,994

Version 4.0  -  21-04-99
-----------

- All parameters now have new names (documentation changed accordingly)
- Parameter `imagesize' (old imsize) now has default of 0.34 deg (20.4 arcm)

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0962

Version 3.1  -  16-03-99
-----------

- Minor change to 3.0, allowing attcalc to work (with attsrc=ahf/om and 
  refpoint=pnt) on files containing no RA_NOM/DEC_NOM or RA_OBJ/DEC_OBJ 
  attributes.

Version 3.0  -  10-03-99
-----------

- removed odfdir parameter (covered by taskmain functionality). Hence present 
  chains may need to be changed - hence new main version number
- boresight correctly handled via CAL_getBoresightMatrix and OAL_toEulerAngles.
- removed call to `call CAL_openCCF("")' 
- uses new h/q mode in parameter file

Version 2.4  -  22-02-99
-----------

A version submitted by Marco to solve a small problem 
(just %positionAngle => %apos)

Version 2.3  -  04-02-99
-----------

The position angle now assumed is the *astronomical* position angle
(XMM-MOC-TN-0109-OAD), and should be in line with SciSim (this closes two
SPRs). The task is now GUI-compatible (an attcalc.lyt file has been created).
Also, the default value of the parameter `imsize' has been reduced to a more
friendly value (20 arcmin). Also the documentation has been updated. 

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0868, 903, 908

Version 2.2  -  10-12-98
-----------

Final delivery before version 2 deadline. Almost identical to Version 2.1, 
apart from one mistake in the transformation, which has been rectified.

Version 2.1  -  02-12-98
-----------

New version, incorporating changes suggested after V2 testing. 
Attsrc and refpoint parameters are now just lowercase. TCRPX and TCDLT 
attributes are read in from input events file.

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0859, 0860, 0867, 0870

Version 2.0  -  17-11-98
-----------

New delivery incorporating a new mandatory parameter (refpoint - hence the
change in major version number), which points to the source of the central
reference point coordinates. Choices are NOM (ra/dec taken from RA_NOM,
DEC_NOM keywords), OBJ (ra/dec taken from RA_OBJ, DEC_OBJ keywords), PNT
(calculated mean pointing over the observation used as ra/dec), an USER (user
input ra/dec). Several SPRs closed with this delivery. 

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0833 to SSC-SPR-0846 (14 SPRs)

Version 1.8  -  03-11-98
-----------

Delivery to hopefully concur with problems with the test ODF summary file.
Lines have been deleted from the test odf summary file, as suggested by Jon
Brumfitt. Because of this, gmake test no longer works at MPE (or at Leicester),
though it should now work at estec.

Version 1.7  -  16-10-98
-----------

Further delivery to incorporate new f90 coding standards. Position angle now
defined as it should be (i.e. now not consistent with (old?) scisim). Still
some confusion as to certain things (attcalc, ep/emevents, CAL etc). These may
change later.

Closed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0560

Version 1.6  -  01-10-98
-----------

Final delivery for version 2
Task changed slightly as confusion existed (and still exists) regarding 
where certain corrections should be done (attcalc, ep/emevents, CAL etc). 
Some confusion still exists also regarding definition of position angle. 
Position angle is defined here to give images consistent with Scisim 
(this may change later). 

Version 1.5  -  16-09-98
-----------

Redelivery to comply with new parameter package

Version 1.4  -  14-09-98
-----------

Slight corrections to Version 1.3. The task contains a dummy odf 
directory which the task accesses in its test. A new 
parameter `odfdir' is included. 

Closed SPRs: 0525 (including all similar occurences of similar errors)

Version 1.3  -  04-09-98
-----------

Redelivery of task, such that it is now compatible with OAL v2.0. 
Also significant changes have occurred in the code, such that an 
intermediate corrected attitude file is now not produced. The task
is also now able to access the AHF via OAL commands (see task 
description). 

Closed SPRs: 0038, 0044, 0313-0316, 0459

Version 1.2  -  29-05-98
-----------

Final task redelivery for SAS v1 (Version 1.2)

Fixed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0287 (test harness fails)

Version 1.1  -  26-05-98
-----------

Final task delivery for SAS v1 (Version 1.1)

Fixed SPRs: SSC-SPR-0029 to 0033, 0035 to 0037, 0039 to 0043, 0045

Version 1.0  -  14-05-98
-----------

Initial version for SAS v1 integration
