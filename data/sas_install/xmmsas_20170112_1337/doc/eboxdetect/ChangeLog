ChangeLog for eboxdetect
===============================

Version 4.27.3 - 2016-12-03 (IT)
--------------
	+ Removed debugging comments from the code after testing v4.27.2.
	+ Updated documentation: Parameter withoffsets=yes (obsolete
	  eident offsets) yields a warning; no other effect anymore.

Version 4.27.2 - 2016-11-23 (IT)
--------------
	+ New algorithm to determine the subimages, in order to avoid
	  memory leaks which could lead to a large number of spurious
	  detections with the gfortran compiler. Tentatively removed the
	  obsolete support of eident offsets. Test version.

Version 4.27.1 - 2016-10-24 (IT)
--------------
	+ ebox_io.f90: fixed an old bug in the calculation of the degrees
	  of freedom of multiple observations, used for the equivalent
	  likelihoods per instrument and image. Has neither affected single
	  observations nor summary lines of the output table. SPR-7400.

Version 4.27 - 2016-09-30 (IT)
--------------
        + Parameter constraints: changed lower limit of parameter ecf
          from 0.001 to 0.0. Purpose: Fluxes can be set to zero (e.g. by
          edetect_stack), if no ecfs are defined.
	+ Number of detections in output list as informational output and
	  new fits keyword NDETECT. Minimum detection likelihood: LIKEMIN.
	  Pixel size: XBINSIZE, YBINSIZE.
	+ ebox_io.f90: Write summary line also if only one instrument is
	  active. Adjusted tests.
	+ edetect_io_box.f90: subimages via imagebuffersize: shift
	  reference point by -16 in x and in y (as in emldetect's
	  edetect_io_ml.f90) in order to make sure that subimages have
	  zero values in their edge rows and columns. "Chains" of spurious
	  detections between the subimage and the image edge may arise
	  otherwise.
	+ edetect_io_box.f90: Made determination of imbuff more concise.
        + DEPEND: updated to emldetect-7.0
	+ cf. SCR 7399: source detection on stacked observations


Version 4.26 - 2016-07-18 (AI)
--------------
	+ gfortran compatibiliy changes applied.
	
Version 4.25.2 - 2016-04-25 (IT)
--------------
        + Throw error "TooManyBands" if images for more than six energy
          bands and / or more than six pimin/pimax are provided. Documented
          error message and maximum number of bands and corrected typo in
          the documentation that resulted in a scrambled line on the
          "obsmode" parameter (SPR-7358 and SPR-7359).

Version 4.25.1 - 2015-10-01 (IT)
--------------
	+ Input data in detector coordinates: Use CDELT1L, CDELT2L
	  header keywords instead of CDELT1, CDELT2 in order to determine
	  the pixel size. For pn and MOS images in detector coordinates,
	  CDELT1/2 have different units.


Version 4.25 - 2015-08-21 (IT)
--------------
	+ Allow input data in detector coordinates (SCR 7289). The
	  coordinate system is determined from the keywords CTYPE1/2 (new
	  arguments to the subroutine co_image): detector coordinates, if
	  DETX/Y. No PSF correction is performed in this case. Detector
	  coordinates of the detections are written to new DETX/DETY columns
	  in the output source list (only!) for input images in detector
	  coordinates. Note: Position errors are not converted into detector
	  coordinates. If required, users can derive them from the
	  X_IMA_ERR, Y_IMA_ERR columns.
	+ Documentation updated.


Version 4.24 - 2015-03-31 (IT)
--------------
	+ new parameter "obsmode" to distinguish between pointing and
	  slew-mode data (SCR 7279). Default: pointing.
	+ eboxdetect_mod.f90: use a flat kernel
	+ eboxdetect_mod.f90: Improved detection of faint extended sources.
	  subroutine msrbkg: Calculate preliminary equivalent likelihoods
	                     of the candidate sources.
	  subroutine match: If irun (i.e.: ncom) > 1, check whether a
	    newly detected candidate has a counterpart in the previous
	    version of the source list AND (new:) whether the equivalent
	    likelihood of the counterpart is above the detection threshold
	    likemin. A previous detection with a likelihood below likemin
	    can be overwritten by a new one now. Otherwise, it might be
	    removed from the final source list because of its low
	    detection likelihood, and faint extended sources might be missed.
	+ documentation updated


Version 4.23 - 2014-08-28 (IT)
--------------
	+ DEPEND: updated to emldetect-6.0
	+ edetect_io_box.f90, documentation: fixed typo in error messages.
	+ edetect_io_box.f90: changed syntax of cp_head to be consistent
	  with other source-detections tasks (call setAttributes). No
	  effects on eboxdetect output.


Version 4.22.5 - 2013-03-17 (IT)
--------------
	+ Documentation updated. Minor latex syntax changes to build the
	  package index properly on Ubuntu


Version 4.22.4 - 2012-06-22 (IT)
---------------------------------

	+ eboxdetect_mod.f90: fixed a bug which made eboxdetect crash when
	  a source is detected exactly at the position (image pixels) of
	  the optical axis.


Version 4.22.3 - 2012-06-18 (IT)
---------------------------------

	+ Documentation: Typographical and formal corrections,
	  fixed broken Errors Section.
	

Version 4.22.2 - 2012-03-27 (IT)
-------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                       
	+ Marked parameter mergedlistset as "not yet implemented" in
	  documentation and parameter file (SPR-6571)
	+ Added parameter descriptions to documentation
	  (withimagebuffersize, imagebuffersize, SPR-6700)
	+ Removed unused imagebuffersizesets entry from parameter file:
          parameter is "imagebuffersize" (SPR-6700)

	
Version 4.22.1 -  2011-02-14 RDS
-------------------------------

	+ src/edetect_io_box.f90

Now checks for the mask in an extension called
MASK and if it doesn't find it, looks in the PRIMARY array.
(SCR-314)


Version 4.22 -  2010-03-11 JR
-------------------------------

Implemented the withimagebuffersize parameter.
This is for the use or not of the imagebuffersize
parameter, meant to be used in the reduction of 
memory requirements. Default value=no. With the default 
value the imagebuffersize parameter will be read
from the header of the image. This also
fix the edetect_chain problem.

     - Smooth SN map lfeld with tapered 5x5 kernel instead box average.
     - Always use 3x3 box in soubroutine 'match' to find local maxima.
