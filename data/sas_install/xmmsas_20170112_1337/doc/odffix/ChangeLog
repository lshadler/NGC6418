Version 2.2 - 2001-10-01 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/odffix.par) posangle range had been changed to 0-360. Go
	back to -180,180 as this breaks pms2odf. 
	
Version 2.1 - 2001-08-20 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/main/OdfConstituent.cc) initialiaze ft to make optimizer
	happy (SOC-SPR-2133)

------------
	+ brought in line with caloalutils-1.43

Version 1.42 - 2000-08-18 (GV)
------------
	+ fix task info and parameter files to comply with new stricter
	specifications (chkdist) .
	
Version 1.41.5 - 2000-07-12 (GV)
--------------
	+ (src/main/OdfObject.*) exclude datasets with "X" from the
	exposure reckonming algorithm.

Version 1.41.4 - 2000-07-11 (GV)
--------------
	+ (src/main/ExposureObject.h) add .scheduled.
	+ (src/main/OdfConstituent.*) add sux_exposure.
	+ (src/main/OdfObject.*) account properly of scheduled/unscheduled
	flags, as the OAL is now sensitive to the difference.

Version 1.41.3 - 2000-07-03 (GV)
--------------
	+ (src/aux/rgsauxtable_mod.f90) updated to remove duplicate frame numbers.
	
Version 1.41.2 - 2000-06-23 (GV)
--------------
	+ (config/odffix.info) fix typo (SOC-SPR-1441).
	+ (doc/odffix_description.tex) fix broken documentation link
	(SOC-SPR-1553).	
	+ Now works on linux, although no specific change was made
	(SOC-SPR-843).
	
Version 1.41.1 - 2000-06-09 (GV)
--------------
	+ (OdfObject.cc) modify the logic of the date-checking algorithm
	(OdfObject::scan), so that the date in checked only for ODF
	constituents whose scheduled flag is S or U. X is ignored as these
	constituents refer to the whole observation instead of a single
	exposure (SOC-SPR-1465). Also, open the dataset only if the date
	has to be checked.
	+ (test/odf) Add one unscheduled exposure, also add one X file
	with abnormal DATE-XXX attributes.
	+ (test/testodffix.cc) update for above changes. Ask the OAL to
	confirm the start/end of the exposure that contains the X file.
	
Version 1.41 - 2000-05-22 (GV)
------------
	+ (config/Makefile) fix typo that prevented par/info files from being creaed.

Version 1.40 - 2000-05-19 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/main/OdfObject.cc) if the OM PWDF exists, do not overwrite it.
	+ add task info files.
	
Version 1.39 - 2000-04-25 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/main/Makefile) move metatask towards the end of
	USEDLIBS. This seems to help some machines not to get segfaults
	(??).
	

Version 1.38 - 2000-04-17 (GV)
------------
	+ (phkgen.cc): these are the ICD compliant names:

	if(iname == "EMOS1"){
	extname = "M1PEH1";
	ftcoarsename = "E1573";
	ftfinename = "EU573";
	} else if(iname == "EMOS2"){
	extname = "M2PEH1";
	ftcoarsename = "K1573";
	ftfinename = "KU573";
	} else if(iname == "EPN"){
	extname = "PNPMH1";
	ftcoarsename = "F1030";
	ftfinename = "FU036;
	
	
Version 1.37 - 2000-04-13 (GV)
------------
	+ (phkgen.cc) column names for the EPICs are now ICD compliant.
	
Version 1.36 2000-03-14 (GV)
------------
	+ (testodffix.cc) now use the OAL to check that the ODF summary
	file is ok.
	+ (OdfObject.cc) call rgsauxtable to fix wrap around in RGS
	auxiliary dataset tables.
	+ (rgsauxtable) new task, from PVideler.

Version 1.35 2000-03-08 (GV)
------------
	+ (OdfObject::scan()) update the map inst_exp_time_map only if
	  asked to check the date, otherwise do not use the new components
          for he calculation of the duration.

Version 1.34 2000-03-02 (GV)
------------
	+ (test/Makefile) fix USEDLIBS to make the static build work.

Version 1.33 2000-03-02 (GV)
------------
	+ (OdfObject.cc) OM THX file not generated if it alredy exists. A
	warning is issued (OMTrackingHistoryDataFileExists). This is in
	response to the PMS now creating these files.

Version 1.32 2000-02-04 (GV)
------------
	+ remove tools from DEPEND, as it was not being used.

Version 1.31 2000-01-21 (GV)
------------
	+ (OdfObject) the smarter algorithm below was not always
	working. Now that algorihm is part of a separate method (validate)
	that is invoked only on the first scan through the directory (to
	avoid repeated warnings) and is more robust against cases when all
	the DATE-XXX keywords are correct.

Version 1.30 2000-01-11 (GV)
------------
	+ (OdfObject) smarter algorithm to guess DATE-OBS/END. If there is
	at least one good DATE-OBS, use that as start time. Otherwise use
	now, and set end to be now + 3600s. If there is no good DATE-END,
	use start + 3600s.
	+ (phkgen) table names comply with ODF ICD. Write FTFINE as
	unsigned16.
	+ (tcfgen) ERTIME is now 23A, as per recent ICD changes.
	
Version 1.29 2000-01-10 (GV)
------------
	+ (OdfObject) keep tabs on the number of good DATE-OBS/END pairs,
	and if none is found make use of an arbitrary start/end time for
	the observation.

Version 1.28 2000-01-10 (GV)
------------
	+ (tcfgen) update for unsigned columns
	+ (nphkgen) same

Version 1.27 1999-12-17 (GV)
------------
	+ (omphkgen): create two extra columns H5215 and H5265

Version 1.26 1999-11-12 (GV)
------------
	+ some datasets were not being closed properly, causing a problem when odffix was run a second time on the same odf directory.
	+ adapt to chage interface for some utility functions in saslib.
	+ use COMBILIBS instead of hack for intermediate library.
	+ will terminate in error if the revolution identifier is not an integer.

Version 1.25 1999-10-08 (GV)
------------
	+ document findnominalpointing.
	+ fix typo that cause INSTRUMEN to be always OM for some HK files.
	+ in ODF summary file, write RA/DEC with more digits.

Version 1.24 1999-09-29 (MB GV)
------------
	+ findnominalpointing is now yes by default
	+ OM window starts now at 0,0 to match the scisim generated values
          for WINDOWX0 and WINDOWY0.

Version 1.23 1999-09-27 (MB)
------------
	+ OM window set to 512x512, binning 2^1 to correspond to the 
          default OM window in scisim of 256x256.

Version 1.22 1999-09-10
------------
	+ change fatals to errors.
	+ add DISTRIBUTION.
	+ (OdfObject::scan()) issue duration-related warnings only if
	number of files != 0. 
	+ (odffix.cc) use pointer to OdfObject to prevent constructor from
	being accidentally invoked in the current directory.

Version 1.21 1999-09-01
------------
	+ new parameter: findnominalpointing (default = no). If this is
	given, then odffix looks for an attitude history file and extracts
	the RA, DEC, PA from the first record. If the attitude history
	file does not exists, the default pointing is (0,0,90).

Version 1.20 1999-09-01
------------
	+ instead of being ignored,datasets with missing DATE-XXXX are
	listed in the odf summary file, but not used to calculate the
	observation's duration.

Version 1.19 1999-08-25
------------
	+ issue a warning if the AT history file is found.
	+ datasets with missing DATE-XXXX attributes are ignored now.

	+ Periodic hk for rgs is _full_ periodic hk (PF instead of PE).
	+ force low memory model to reduce mem usage.
	+ check sanity of DATE strings
