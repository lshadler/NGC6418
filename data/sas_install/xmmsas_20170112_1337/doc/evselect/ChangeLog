	+ Fix bug which in some cases caused the last bin (ie. row) in a histogram
	  or lightcurve not to be created.  Closes SSC-SPR-2656.
	+ If the column used to accumulate a histogram is named COUNTS, it now gets
	  rename to OLD_COUNTS in the histogram, instead of crashing evselect.

Version 3.39 - 2001-09-24 (DH)
------------
	+ Changed all standard containers to use the explicit std:: scope operator.

	  exposure information.
	+ Fix some errors in the documentation introduced in 3.38 .
	+ Fix error in algorithm used for caculating exposure for a spectrum region
	  that spans more than one ccd.  Exposure was being over estimated.

------------
	+ Test for zero bin sizes.  Fixes SSC-SPR-2241.
	+ Add writing of LTV/LTM coordinate keywords to extracted images.  Closes

	  linux.

Version 3.32.1 - 2000-10-12 (DH)
--------------
	+ Add documentation and layout for the dssclean parameter.
	+ Evselect now only filters EXPOSUnn extension if keepfilteroutput=true, ie.
	  only when the event list is being written out or modified.

------------
	+ Change error checking for datasubspace parser, so that now a warning is issued
	  in case of failure, rather than an error.
	+ New parameter 'calculatebackscale', which turns on the calculation of the BACKSCAL
	  keyword for spectra.  Closes SSC-SPR 1944.
	+ Changes to prevent BACKSCAL calculation from consuming unreasonable amounts of
	  memory.  Hopefull closes SSC-SPR 1958.

Version 3.30 - 2000-09-22 (DH)
------------
	+ In exposure correction, allow for a TIMEDEL keyword replacing a TIMEDEL column
	  in the EXPOSUnn extensions.
	+ New parameter ingorelegallimits, which if true causes evselect to ingore TLMIN
	  and TLMAX when keywords when setting column extraction limits.

------------
	+ Test whether x/y columns exist before trying to calculate the BACKSCAL
	  keyword.  Closes SCC-SPR-1932.
	+ Change slightly meaning of keepfilteroutput parameter, so that if it is
	  false, then the value of the withfilteredset is ignored, and no output
	  event list is written. Closes SSC-SPR-1930.
	
Version 3.26 - 2000-07-19 (DH)
------------
	+ Incorporates all changes through evselect 3.25.10.

	+ Fix the some bad uses of the kn macro in the documentation.  Closes SPRs
	  1895 and 1896.
	+ Add 'squarepixels' parameter, which forces x and y bin sizes to be the same
	  when imagebinning=imageSize.  Update documentation.  Closes SOC SCR 1607.
	+ Add 'Sparse' message about the number of events selected.  Closes SCR on
	  "NUmber of selected events".

	  extraction under special circumstances.

Version 3.20 - 2000-03-22 (DH)
------------
	+ Fix bug that was causing crashes when an image was extracted
	  under certain special conditions.  Evselect was writing
	  outside of array bounds (closes SPR 1586).
	+ Make calculation of exposure information more robust - a
	  DSS spec is no longer required, and some problems dealing
	  with missing EXPOUSnn extensions fixed.

Version 3.19 - 2000-03-08 (DH)

	+ Switch to using tempnam to generate temporary file names.

Version 3.17 - 2000-02-29 (DH)
------------
	+ Add data subspace 'cleaning' to generation of dss info in
	  evselect.  See description of cleanDSS in dsslib documentation
	  for details.
	+ Minor change to layout file, making updateexposure dependant on
	  writedss.
	+ Remove unexecutable block from evselect.cc .

Version 3.16 - 2000-02-24 (DH)
------------
	+ Fix SPR 1500, spectrum extraction requires CCDNR column
	+ Change spectrum extraction so that it now does true binning,
	  instead of OGIP grouping.  Keywords are written to the spectrum
	  giving information on the binning and offset.

Version 3.15 - 2000-02-21 (UL)
------------
	+ brought in line with selectlib-4.28 (selected rows are now marked
	  by _setting_ flag bit)
	+ updated description of parameters 'flagbit'/'flagcolumn' accordingly

Version 3.14 - 2000-02-21 (DH)
------------
	+ Fixed up DEPEND file.
	+ Changes to test harness to improve test harness.
	
Version 3.13 - 2000-02-17 (DH)
------------
	+ Exposure information now updated by evselect, as per agreed
	  procedures.  New parameter updateexposure to control this,
	  turned off by default.  Closes SPR 1315.  Docuemntation
	  updated.

Version 3.12 - 2000-02-15 (UL)
------------
	+ if "imagebinning=imageSize" store effective bin size in task
	  parameters "xy/imagebinsize" such that meta-tasks like xmmselect
	  can read them; this is necessary to fix SOC-SPR 1148: region not
	  properly transformed when imagebinning=imageSize

Version 3.11 - 2000-02-10 (DH)
------------
	+ Fixed bug which caused read-only failure in some cases when using
	  a null filtering expression.
	+ Fixed SPR 1461, "evselect not recognising WCS keywords".  This was
	  due to the fact that the block copying function in the Dal does not
	  copy column attributes.

Version 3.10 - 2000-02-04 (UL)
------------
	+ for keepfilteredoutput=no the input data set is now copied to
	  a Temp data set which is destructively filtered; advantage:
	  in highmem mode, the filtered Temp set is never written back to
	  disk which improves the execution time; in the lowmem case, the
	  opening of the Temp set can be enforced in highmem mode with
	  tempsetmemenv=false

Version 3.9 - 2000-02-02 (DH)
-----------
	+ Fix SPR 1450 "Attempts to modify read-only object".  Fix also closes

-----------
	+ First version with data subspace support
	+ Fix problem with sizing of images from integer-valued columns
	+ Replace boolean parameter withimagebinsize with string parameter imagebinning.
	  This change is not backward compatible, but should only effect the down-stream
	  task imagechain.
	+ Incorporate new parameters into layout file.
	+ Rationalize the behaviour of keepfilteredoutput and withfilteredset parameters

	  propogated to the products.  The old history keywords specifying
	  the parameters used in evselect have been removed.
