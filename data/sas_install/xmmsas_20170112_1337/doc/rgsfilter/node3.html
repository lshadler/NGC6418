removes unwanted frames and events from the combined
 event list for RGS.  The internal node-specific exposure maps are
 also constructed (or reconstructed) so that they comply with the
 filtering of the frames and events.  This is important for tasks such
 as <A NAME="617"></A><A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="../rgsspectrum/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsspectrum</SPAN></A>
and <A NAME="621"></A><A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="../rgsrmfgen/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsrmfgen</SPAN></A>, which use these maps to

perform exposure corrections.  Lastly, a single exposure map for the
 entire focal plane is constructed by combining the node-specific
 maps.  An event list may be filtered repeatedly by <A NAME="625"></A><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="../rgsfilter/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsfilter</SPAN></A>,

and typically the user will start with an event list that has already
 been filtered for bad events and corrupted frames, and apply
 additional filtering on hand-selected time-intervals.
 <A NAME="629"></A><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="../rgsfilter/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsfilter</SPAN></A>
is not a generalized selection engine: it filters on
 frame timestamp and certain event flags only.  All other filtering,
 for which the exposure maps do not need to be rebuilt (or for which
 this is either not feasible or not well defined), is left to other
 tasks.  Throughout this document a <IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="\dag"> marks items that do not
 apply to High Time Resolution (HTR) mode data.

<P>
The filtering of frames is specified for each CCD separately through
 OGIP standard tables of Good Time Intervals (GTI).  The
 time-filtering that has been applied to the event list is described
 by its <A NAME="633"></A><TT>STDGTI0n</TT> tables.  Strictly speaking, these tables may
 be more prescriptive than descriptive on the input, but are always
 descriptive on the output.  To further restrict the GTI, a list of
 auxiliary GTI tables may be specified (parameter
 <TT>auxgtitables</TT>) and are applied as a filter to each of the
 <A NAME="636"></A><TT>STDGTI0n</TT> tables.  These tables are also filtered to remove
 any frames that lack attitude correction or lie partially outside the
 GTI.  The output <A NAME="638"></A><TT>STDGTI0n</TT> tables, whether altered or not, are
 applied as a filter to the <A NAME="640"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT>, <A NAME="642"></A><TT>EXPOSU0n</TT> and
 <A NAME="644"></A><TT>REJPIXnn</TT> tables.  The filtering of events is specified
 through event flags (parameter <TT>rejflags</TT>).  The
 event-filtering that has been applied to the event list is described
 by the <A NAME="647"></A><TT>REJFLAGS</TT> attribute of the <A NAME="649"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table.  Events
 with these flags are removed from the <A NAME="651"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table, but not
 from the <A NAME="653"></A><TT>REJPIXnn</TT> tables.  When the exposure maps are
 constructed the <A NAME="655"></A><TT>REJFLAGS</TT> attribute determines which entries in
 the <A NAME="657"></A><TT>REJPIXnn</TT> tables are selected.  Event-filtering is
 restricted to the enumerated subset of the <A NAME="659"></A><TT>EVENTS</TT> table
 <A NAME="661"></A><TT>FLAG</TT> bits that are recommended for rejecting events.  Note
 that all uplinked bad pixels are always left unexposed in the
 exposure maps regardless of what flags are set in <A NAME="663"></A><TT>REJFLAGS</TT>.

<P>
An exposure map provides the effective amount of active,
 photon-collecting time as a function of discrete (binned) position on
 the surface of the chip.  The map values are in units of seconds, and
 the coordinate system is aspect-corrected RGS angles (dispersion and
 cross-dispersion). After <A NAME="665"></A><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="../rgsfilter/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsfilter</SPAN></A>
version 1.18, the units for
 the dispersion axis in the exposure maps coordinate can be in:

<UL>
<LI>Beta space 
</LI>
<LI>Lambda space
</LI>
</UL>
being the orthogonal axis always cross-dispersion. The
 <TT>spectrumbinning</TT> should be used to switch between these two
 dispersion axis units. Note that this definition of an exposure map differs
 somewhat from the common practice in X-ray Astronomy.  Each
 node-specific map contains the contribution of active time from one
 node only, and in general there will be some overlap between the maps
 at the node boundary because of aspect drift.  The total active time
 in the region of overlap is the sum of both contributions.  The
 aspect-correction of the angular coordinates requires
 source-dependent parameters which are added to the event list by
 <A NAME="670"></A><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="../rgsangles/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rgsangles</SPAN></A>.  The validity of the exposure maps with respect to

other possible targets is limited by this implicit choice of nominal
 target.  The construction of the exposure map would be unreasonably
 slow if every frame were treated independently of the others.
 Instead, the frames are grouped together into bins according to their
 aspect correction and the average aspect correction in each bin is
 used to lay down the exposure for all of its frames.  The bin size is
 configurable (parameter <TT>driftbinsize</TT>), but the default is
 both very fast and very accurate.

<P>
In principle one would not expect to find negative values in an
 exposure map, but because of certain algorithmic difficulties
 negative values do occur.  The largest of these (in absolute value)
 are due to the nearly negligible curvature of the angular coordinate
 system, and only manifest along the top and bottom edges of the chip.
 This effect should not be larger than roughly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$10^{-5}$"></SPAN> of the total
 exposure (characterized by the <A NAME="675"></A><TT>DATAMAX</TT> attribute).  Much
 smaller, and more widespread, are the errors due to round-off:
 inevitably, spurious infinitesimal values, both positive and
 negative, are occasionally found in unexposed pixels.  To suppress
 this disconcerting effect any pixel with absolute value less than
 <!-- MATH
 $3\times 2^{-24}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$3\times 2^{-24}$"></SPAN> of the total exposure is reset to zero in the final
 map.  Any negative values that remain most likely represent a
 systematic error.
