ChangeLog for epreject
======================

Version 5.17 - 2016-05-06 (MJF)
-------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): test on existence and completeness of offset map
  list introduced in previous version. Write also keyword OFSTFILE to EXPSOURE
  extension as the used offset map may originate from a different ODF.

Version 5.16 - 2015-03-24 (MJF)
-------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): allow input list of offset maps (instead of the ones
  identified by the OAL, or sometimes not identified ;-)
  This is useful in the case when the offset maps were dumped before or after
  the observation with different ObsID (e.g., early mission data, slews, ...)
  Moreover, this new feature enables calibration work without changing contents
  of ODF/SDF data or CCF files.
  This is controlled via new boolean parameter "withoffsetlist" (default "N")
  that takes precedence over "withoffsetmap" if set to "Y": it opens the file
  specified in new parameter "odilist" and reads the ODI name to be used
  from there. The input list is an ASCII with 2-digit CCD number followed
  by a blank and then the path to the offset map for that CCD (there can be
  more than one offset map in that file so that the input file can be used
  for the whole observation processing; only the first entry for a particular
  CCD is used; the order does not matter). (SOC/SAS-SCR-7284)
- (config/epreject.*): as above
- (doc/epreject_description.tex): as above

Version 5.15 - 2014-05-02 (MJF)
-------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): write boolean keyword "OFSTCOR4" whether calibration
  parameters for offset correction have been available (SOC/SAS-SCR-7199)

Version 5.14.6 - 2013-11-06 (MJF)
---------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): make sure that epreject is not called twice, and
  that epreject and epxrlcorr are not called together to avoid double correction

Version 5.14.5 - 2013-06-14 (MJF)
---------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): make sure that X-ray loading correction is not
  applied if filter during offset map calculation was CLOSED. Also ensure
  that it is not applied twice (e.g. accidentally in interactive analysis)
- (test/epreject_test): added SAS_CCF and "withxrlcorrection=Y"
closed SPR:
- SPR-7115: epreject applies X-ray loading correction also if offset map was
  computed with Closed filter

Version 5.14.4 - 2012-05-23 (MJF)
---------------------------------
- (doc/epreject_description.tex): describe algorithm for X-ray loading
  correction (SOC-SCR-331)

Version 5.14.3 - 2012-05-18 (MJF)
---------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): avoid uninitialized pointer I2OFFSET in the case of
  3dim (i.e. HDI) offset maps

Version 5.14.2 - 2012-05-17 (MJF)
---------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): write keyword XRLCORR if X-ray loading correction
  has been applied (SOC-SCR-331)

Version 5.14.1 - 2012-03-30 (MJF)
---------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): X-ray loading correction completed (SOC-SCR-331)
- (doc/epreject_description.tex): as above
- (DEPEND): needs "cal-3.209.1"

Version 5.14 - 2012-03-20 (MJF)
-------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): added X-ray loading correction for fast (TI+BU)
   modes (SCR-331), not fully implemented
- (config/epreject.*): added new parameter "withxrlcorrection" (default "N") 

Version 5.13 - 2012-02-22 (MJF)
-------------------------------
- (src/epreject_mod.f90): added new parameter "withnoisehandling"
  (default N) to separate CCD offset and noise handling (latter
  could be covered by new task "epnoise" instead)
- (config/epreject.*): as above
- (doc/epreject_description.tex): as above
- (doc/epreject_description.tex): some editorial changes


Version 5.12 - 2010-02-19 (HB)
--------------------------------
	
+ (src/epreject_mod.f90) Corrects an error which caused epreject to crash
	                 when attempting tho read *HDI.FIT offset maps.
	
	
Version 5.11 - 2008-04-08 (HB)
------------------------------
+ (src/epreject_mod.f90) writes keywords OFSTCOR1, OFSTCOR2, OFSTCOR3,
	                 to exposure extension, giving offset correction 
	                 method, number of corrected events, and number 
	                 of events shifted below the threshold;
	                 sets new flag EVATT_BELOW_ACCEPTANCE for events 
	                 below threshold (this replaces the temporary 
	                 use of flag EVATT_TRAILING for the same purpose
                  implemented in v5.8)             
	                   
	                 
		
ersion 5.10.1 - 2007-11-08 (EO)
--------------
        + This version contains the same code than 5.10 but it is
          made to restate the flow of versions after previous upload.


Version 5.9.1 - 2007-11-08 (EO)
-------------
        + In order to make a patch to SAS 7.1.0 with the contents of
          version 5.10 of this package, a copy of its code was made into
          version number 5.9.1. That way, SAS 7.1.0 binaries depending
          on libepreject.so.5.9, i.e. epproc and odfbrowser, could find it
          without trouble.
        + Therefore a package epreject-5.9.1 will exist with a release date
          after epreject-5.10.
        + In order to restate the normal flow of package releases,
          after this package is uploaded, a new version 5.10.1 with
          the same contents that 5.10, will be uploaded.


Version 5.10 - 2007-08-09 (HB)
------------------------------
+ (src/epreject_mod.f90) prevented PHA values from going negative if
                         illegal values in master offset are encountered;
                         corrected error in soft flare screening code


Version 5.9 - 2007-03-22 (HB)
-----------------------------
+ (src/epreject_mod.f90) reads and applies MasterOffsetMap (needs devtrack 
	                 CCF EPN_REJECT_0004.CCF); changed LaTex description 
	                 to fix problem with image display in LaTex to 
	                 HTML conversion (SSC-SPR-3655 closed)
	
	
Version 5.8 - 2006-08-04 (MJF)
--------------------------------

+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): assign temporarily to events below the event threshold
                   (i.e. after offset correction) a rejection flag like for
                   reemission events to prevent inclusion in pattern recognition
                   and energy corrections. 

	
Version 5.7 - 2005-04-26 (HB)
-----------------------------

+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): if noise screening is not yet calibrated:
	                  skip noise screening, only perform offset 
	                  correction

Version 5.6 - 2005-04-18 (HB)
-----------------------------

+ (test/epreject_test): test harness fixed	

Version 5.5 - 2005-03-23 (MJF, HB)
----------------------------------	

+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): if uncalibrated mode do nothing
+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): check for (yet) uncalibrated modes, issue warnings
+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): added/modified diagnostic output
+ (config/epreject.par): changed default of "withoffsetmap" from "N" to "Y"

Version 5.4 - 2004-11-08 (HB)
-------------------------------

+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): calculation of offset correction directly from
	                  offset maps (new default); old method (offset
	                  correction based on 20 adu images) still available
	                  for datasets where no offset maps are available;
	                  new task parameter: -set, -withoffsetmap
+ (config/epreject.par): new task parameters added
+ (config/epreject.lyt): new task parameters added
+ (doc/epreject_description.tex): new algorithm and task parameters added

Version 5.3.1 - 2004-01-29 (HB)

-------------------------------

+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): code to flag soft flare events added (turned off
	                  by default)
	
Version 5.2 - 2003-12-08 (HB)
-------------------------------

+ (src/epreject_mod.f90): call to random number generator corrected
+ (doc/epreject_description.tex): figures added
