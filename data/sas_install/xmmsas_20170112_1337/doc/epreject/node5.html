While there is practically no detector noise present at energies above
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img17.png"
 ALT="$\sim200\mbox{ eV}$"></SPAN> are considerably
contaminated by noise events, which become more and more dominant towards the
lowest transmitted energies (Fig.<A HREF="node4.html#pn059207_003">1</A>). Investigations of
40&nbsp;hours of in-orbit calibration data with the filter wheel closed, taken
over a period of more than two years, showed that the noise properties vary
with position and energy, but are fairly stable in time for most areas on the
detector. This property enables a statistical approach for suppressing the
detector noise. The task uses the information about the spatial and spectral
dependence of the detector noise in order to flag and optionally remove, on a statistical basis, the
amount of events which correspond to the expected noise.
Apart from a dramatic reduction of the event file size (if the noise
events are physically removed) this procedure thus has the additional 
advantage to correctly treat the spatial and spectral
properties of the detector noise in a more straightforward manner than
would be possible by conventional background subtraction.  

<P>

<P></P>
The noise properties were derived from a total of 10 exposures with
closed filter wheel between
XMM-Newton revs. 129 and 532, yielding a total exposure time of 144&nbsp;ks. These
measurements were first corrected for offset shifts (see above) and then used
for accumulating PHA spectra below 65&nbsp;adu, individually for each CCD row. The
fine spacing in RAWY was chosen because the noise properties change
considerably with distance from the readout node, in particular close to the
CAMEX. In order to get a sufficient number of events, no subdivision was made
along the CCD rows (i.e. along RAWX). This approach was motivated by the fact
that the noise properties do not show a pronounced dependence along this
direction (unless there is a bright column). As the resulting spectra suffered
somewhat from low count rate statistics, they were smoothed along RAWY with a
running median filter extending over <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img18.png"
 ALT="$\pm5$"></SPAN> rows. This smoothing was not
applied to rows with <!-- MATH
 $\mbox{RAWY}<20$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img19.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{RAWY}&lt;20$"></SPAN>, where the spectra contained more counts
and where the dependence of the spectra on RAWY was high.

<P>

<P></P>
For the flagging of potential noise events in a specific observation, the
number of events in each (CCDNR, RAWY, PHA) bin is compared with the
corresponding value in the noise data (scaled to the same exposure). According
to the ratio between the actual number of events and the expected noise
contribution in each (CCDNR, RAWY, PHA) bin, individual events are then
randomly flagged. In order to improve the statistics somewhat, the spectra
from the observation to be corrected are internally smoothed by a running
median filter along RAWY, for rows with <!-- MATH
 $\mbox{RAWY}\ge20$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{RAWY}\ge20$"></SPAN>, in a similar way
as the noise spectra, before the noise contribution is computed. The data set
itself, however, remains unchanged by this task, except for receiving the
additional flags.

<P>

<P></P>
The data from exposures where the filter wheel was closed, show that the noise
properties may exhibit some temporal variations, which are usually similar in
all CCDs of a quadrant. In order to allow some fine tuning to an individual
observation, twelve parameters can be controlled by the user. 
These parameters <TT>noiseparameters</TT>
specify the relative amount of noise in each CCD. An additional parameter
controls the maximum percentage of events in each (CCDNR, RAWY, PHA) bin,
which may be considered as noise. This parameter should be set to a value
which is slightly below 100% (default: 98%), to take the fact into account
that even in the exposures with the filter wheel closed, which were used for
deriving the noise properties, not all events are due to detector noise. There
is, e.g., some additional flux present from fluorescence at the filter wheel
itself, triggered by energetic particles. This component would change with the
position of the filter wheel. The appropriate setting of these parameters
should be checked by accumulating an image of all events with low PHA values
(below <!-- MATH
 $\sim25\mbox{ adu}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="68" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="$\sim25\mbox{ adu}$"></SPAN>) which were not flagged as noise events. If there
was no bright, extended X-ray source in the field of view, then the events
should be distributed homogeneously across the image.

<P>

<P></P>
If a satisfactory suppression of noise events can be achieved, then this task
allows to extend the useful energy range to an instrumental energy of
<!-- MATH
 $\sim120\mbox{ eV}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$\sim120\mbox{ eV}$"></SPAN>. Below this energy, parts of the detector become
essentially insensitive due to the low energy threshold applied onboard and
the combined effect of charge transfer loss and gain variations within the 768
amplifiers in the EPIC-pn camera. In addition to the improvement of the data
quality, removing the events which were flagged as noise events will also make
the files considerably smaller and easier to handle. Tests have shown that up
to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="$\sim90\%$"></SPAN> of all the events can be removed from the original data set by
this method (e.g.Fig.<A HREF="node4.html#pn0462ff_cls_3">6</A>).

<B>Caveats:</B></DIV>

<P>

<P></P>
Tests with exposures taken between XMM-Newton revs. 129 and 532 indicate
that the noise properties did not change much during this period. However,
there may be cases where the noise properties deviate significantly from the
behavior expected by this task. This may have happened in particular early in
the mission when the offset map was computed with a different method

<P>

<P></P>
This task was verified to yield satisfactory results down to exposures of
<!-- MATH
 $\sim5\mbox{ ks}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$\sim5\mbox{ ks}$"></SPAN>. For considerably shorter exposures, however, there is
a limitation due to count rate statistics (how should one remove, e.g.,
20% of the events if there is only one event present?). It is therefore
always recommended to check the results with the method described above.
