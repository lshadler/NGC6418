Version 1.4.2   - 2007-11-23 (RDS)
-----------
	+ (config/backscale.par,lyt)   
	+ Documentaion update          

	No longer necessary to provide the detector map to calculate
	the BACKSCAL for MASK observations.

Version 1.4.1 - 2007-11-08 (EO)
-------------
        + This version contains the same code than 1.4 but it is
          made to restate the flow of versions after previous upload.

Version 1.3.3 - 2007-11-08 (EO)
-------------
        + In order to make a patch to SAS 7.1.0 with the contents of
          version 1.4 of that package, a copy of that code was made into
          version 1.3.3. That way, SAS 7.1.0 binaries depending on
          libbackscale.so.1.3 (besides backscale itself, xmmselect)
          could find it without trouble.
        + Therefore a package backscale-1.3.3 will exist with a release
          date after backscale-1.4.
        + In order to restate the normal flow of package versions,
          after that package was uploaded, a new version 1.4.1 with
          the same contents that 1.4, will be uploaded.

Version 1.4   - 2007-08-17 (RDS)
-----------
	+ (src/backscale.cc,
	   config/backscale.par,lyt)   

	+ Documentaion update

	Added the option of specifying the detector map as an image
	with the 'detmaptype' and 'detmaparray' parameters.
	This solves the problem with calculating the backscale value 
	for regions containing a spatial mask (SPR-2723)
