ChangeLog for eposcorr
===============================

Version 3.12.2 - 2012-03-28 (IT)
------------------------------
	+ Coordinates in match table: X_RA and X_DEC are set to the
          coordinates in the input X-ray source list (instead of
  	  intermediate results; SPR-6635).
	+ Optical input source list: RA, DEC, and RADEC_ERR columns
	  can be given in single or in double precision (user request
	  in March 2012; SPR-6701).
	+ Updated documentation.

	
Version 3.12.1 - 2008-05-09 GL
-----------------------------------  

Correct an error with using the parameter rawxsyserr,
introduced in v 3.9.2.
Close SOC-SPR 6436 (SSC-SPR 3701).

	
	
Version 3.12 - 2007-05-25 GL
-----------------------------------  

Fixed documentation.

	
Version 3.11 - 2006-05-23 GL
----------------------------------- 

Copy of 3.9.3 for SAS 7
	
	
Version 3.9.3 - 2006-02-07 GL
-----------------------------------

Updated documentation


	
Version 3.9.2 - 2005-06-21 GL
-----------------------------------

Changed column names containing "-" in match table:
 X-INDEX -> X_INDEX
 X-RA ->    X_RA
 X-DEC ->   X_DEC
 O-INDEX -> O_INDEX
 O-RA ->    O_RA
 O-DEC ->   O_DEC

 Look for RA_PNT/DEC_PNT in both PRIMARY array and source list extension.	
 Write axis information of the likelihood image as physical coordinate system.
 (see SSC-SPR-3305) 

 Improve efficiency by a large factor 
   a) by reusing results of rotational coordinate transformations.
   b) by reducing the input list to 1 row per source already on
      reading the source list.
 Write likelihood bias expected due to optical background source density 
   into keyword LIK_NULL of the corrected source list.
  (see SSC-SPR-3493)
 Update test harness
	

	
Version 3.10 - 2004-03-19 GL
-----------------------------	

Fixed problem that caused segmentation fault, when
no error column was present in optical catalogue.

Version 3.9.1 - 2002-03-02 GL
-----------------------------

Change coordinates in matchtable to double precision.

Version 3.9 - 2002-12-08 GL
-----------------------------

Make use of param v2 features in .par file


Version 3.8 - 2002-10-29 GL
-----------------------------

Update DEPEND
Created lyt  file
Changed info file
Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2926  misleading duplicate error code.

	
Version 3.7 - 2002-05-24 GL
-----------------------------

Based on v3.4.2
+ Converted .par file to XML
	
Version 3.4.2 (2002-05-15) HB
-----------------------------

New task parameters added:
rawxsyserr,r,h,1.5,,,"systematic error of input X-ray positions"
minxsyserr,r,h,0.2,,,"irreducible systematic error of X-ray positions"
maxsig,r,h,5.0,,,"sigma cutoff for X-ray/optical matches"
usemaxsig,b,h,yes,,,"use sigma cutoff limit"

maxposnerr internally multiplied by sqrt(0.5) to achieve consitency
  with RADEC_ERR values
	
Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2863 inproperly fixed SPR 2830 corrected
	
Version 3.6 (2002-04-20) HB
---------------------------	

Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2830 Number of matches does not account for multiple rows

Version 3.5 (2000-01-28) HB
---------------------------

-Error in parameter file corrected	
	
Version 3.4 (2001-10-17) HB
---------------------------

-error in the test harness corrected	
	
Version 3.3 (2001-10-13) HB
---------------------------

-units of RA, DEC, and error columns now read from source table
-position error column no longer required
-optional output of table containing matched sources with distances and 
 likelihood contributions for each matched pair
-RA, DEC offsets and rotation angle can optionally be specified as 
 input parameters instead of being determined by the programme	
-column names for R and B magnitues now specified by input parameter
 	
Version 3.2 (2001-08-13) HB
---------------------------

Closed SPRs:	  
+ SSC-SPR-2486 Fails to compile with NAG F95 4.1
+ SSC-SPR-2357 Allow correlating X-ray sources with one another
+ SSC-SPR-2316 SCR 56task puts too many restrictions on input file
	
Version 3.1.1 (2001-06-01) HB
-----------------------------	

Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2414 broken link in HTML doc	
	

Version 3.1 (D.M., September 22., 2000)
----------------------
	+ Possibility to reduce positional error by only considering
	  strong sources with low positional error: Parameter maxposnerr

Version 3.0 (JV, Juli 21, 2000)
----------------------	
	+ Possibility to search for rotational errors added (but is still slow)
	+ Parameters added/changed
	
Version 2.0.1 (JV, June 16, 2000)
----------------------	
	+ missing info file added
	+ changed the internal error representation as there was a discrepancy
	between documentation and code.
	+ as a consequence the test harness had to be changed as well
	
Version 2.0 (JV, June 2000)
----------------------	
- Changed the names of keywords added by eposcorr to the source list data set.
- Added some additional keywords.
- Parameters added in order to select R and B magnitudes from the input optical
	set.
	


Version 1.1
----------------------	
- The task has been updated to work properly with the latest summary srclists.
  See SSC-SPR-1272, 1273, 1274
- Added a keyword describing the approximate error in the position correction
  applied.
	


Version 1.0
----------------------------	
Remarks about this version.

This version is similar to v 0.1, but I have changed
the test files and removed the *.cc files.
See SSC-SPR-1253, SSC-SPR-1248, SSC-SPR-1129, SSC-SPR-1117.
