ChangeLog for ommodmap
======================
Version 2.24 - 2013-07-11 (VNY)
-----------
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): Introduced a check of the binning
 	factor by comparing the header keyword window size (unbinned)
	and the real image size
Version 2.23 - 2012-12-13 (VNY)
-----------
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): protected from possible subscript
	errors in the arrays mod8Tile and TotalInMod8Col
Version 2.22 - 2011-07-12 (VNY)
------------	
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): further protection against
	possible undefined values of  the variables mod8xmin 
	and mod8ymin
Version 2.21 - 2011-06-07 (VNY)
------------	
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): protected against the possibility
	of getting undefined values of the variables mod8xmin 
	and mod8ymin (on some computers)
Version 2.20 - 2011-05-21 (VNY)
------------	
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): protected against possible 
	crashes with a subscript error message (SPR-6656)
Version 2.19.2 - 2009-07-21 (CB) 
--------------
        +test Deleted ssc from Makefile to fix gcc4 build failure	
Version 2.19.1 - 2009-07-20 (CB) 
        +src Deleted ssc from Makefile to fix gcc4 build failure.	
Version 2.19 - 2009-02-17 (CB1) 
        Delete ampersand from line 1094 to fix build problem
	(not sure how it got there).
Version 2.18 - 2009-02-14 (CB1) 
        Delete SSCLIB from DEPEND file to fix dependency failure.
Version 2.17.2 - 2008-05-14 (VNY) +(src/recover16bits_mod.f90)
	Restricting the number of calls to a recourcive procedure
	(checkConnectedPixels) to 2500 to protect the task from
	crashing when processing unusual images (or images with 
	very bright sources). This is the real fix of SSC-SPR-6458
	(the previous version didn'n fix it). 
Version 2.17.1 - 2008-05-12 (VNY) +(test/testommodmap): Removing
	wrong files from the test directory to avoid error
	messages during the test procedure (SSC-SPR-6458)
Version 2.17 - 2008-04-08 (VNY) +(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): Checking 
	for the size of the bad-pixel region and, if this region is 
	small (currently checking the 60 by 60-pixel vertical cross) 
	then include this region for the mod-8 correction. 
	Otherwise the region will remain uncorrected in order to 
	prevent the infinite cycling of the task (SSC-SPR-3715).	
Version 2.16 - 2007-07-23 (VNY) +(src/ommodmap_mod.f90): Bulding 
	the modulo-8 mask for those pixels that were labelled as "bad" 
	in the quality image is disabled to prevent the indefinite cycling 
	of the task on images with black strips (fixing SSC-SPR-3696).
Version 2.15.4 - 2005-02-23 (VNY) +(/src/ommodmap_mod.f90): The value 
	of MJDREF is set to 50814, in accordance with the changes 
	made 04.06.2004 in OMFASTSHIFT, SSC-SPR-3333. 
	The old value (5.08140007312960D+04) was only used in 
	rare occasions when the MJDREF key was abscent in the header.
	So, this change practically does not affect the performance 
	of the task.	
Version 2.15.3 - 2004-06-09 (VNY) A bug causing problem of subscript 
	in mod8TileDX and mod8TileDY mask arrays is fixed, SSC-SPR-3336
        (the meaning of the variables xmax and ymax has been changed 
	since long ago, but in a piece of code they still were understood 
	as dx and dy) 	
Version 2.15.2 - 2004-05-20 (VNY)
------------	
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90) 
	The limiting counts/pixel value is increased from 
	50000 to 250000 to ensure that no useful photometric 
	information is lost (SSC-SPR-3323)
	
Version 2.15.1 - 2003-12-18 (CB)
------------
	Modification made to prevent window parameters not being
	changed for non-grism images (fixes SPR 3188).
	
Version 2.15 - 2003-11-26 (VNY)
------------
	Protected against inconsistency of the image size and DETSEC
	attribute +(src/ommodmap_mod.f90)
	
Version 2.14 - 2003-11-18 (CB)
------------
	DEPEND file ammended for ssclib 3.0
	
Version 2.13 - 2003-11-18 (VNY) +(src/Makefile) link to SASDAL added
	to the makefile in order to rectify the static build
	
Version 2.12 - 2003-11-13 (VNY) +(src/Makefile) changed the order
	of calling the libraries (in order to get properly the static 
	build)
	
Version 2.11 - 2003-11-04  (VNY) 
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90) +(config/ommodmap.par) Parameter
	mod8correction changed its type: from boolean to integer
	(SAS-SCR-116)
	
Version 2.10 - 2003-10-29  (VNY)
------------
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90) A bug leading to the divided by two 
	output image is fixed (SSC-SPR-3160)
	
Version 2.9 - 2003-10-24 (VNY)
-----------	
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90) Small bugs are fixed. The programme is 
	adjusted to the grism data; new parameter (mod8correction)
	added - SSC-SCR-116
	
Version 2.8 - 2003-10-07 (VNY)
-----------	
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90) Allocation of the bad pixel map
	is corrected (this caused infinite cycling in some 
	data sets with OM grism images) - SSC-SPR-3156
	
Version 2.7 - 2003-09-30 (VNY) 
----------
	+(config/ommodmap.par) 
	+(src/ommodmap_mod.f90)
	+(doc/ommodmap_description.tex)
	New parameters have been added, permitting
	the OM XMM flat field to be used to determine the Mod-8
	noise pattern. This would be useful for the fields with 
	not sufficient number of photons or for the grism images.
	The modification is made in accordance with SCR-116.
	The new parameters do not change the task's interface
	since they are not mandatory.
Version 2.6 - 2002-09-26 (VNY)
-----------
	DEPEND file updated (dependence on SAS-1.312 included)
