ChangeLog for ebkgreg
===============================

Version 0.7.2 - 2016-10-28 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Documentation updated

Version 0.7.1 - 2016-07-20 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Documentation updated

Version 0.7 - 2016-06-22 (JVP)
-----------
	+ (src/ebkgreg.cc	- In addition to PN, MOS1/2 cameras are also covered by this task.
	   src/ProcSrcList.cc	- Background extraction region is CIRCLE, or ANNULUS only for MOS1/2 in
	   src/Bkgreg.cc	  SmallWindow mode (PrimePartialW2/3) and the source is in the
	   src/Bkgreg.h		  central CCD (CCDnr = 1). In this case the annulus has always the same size
	   src/Lookupradius.cc	  and it covers the external CCDs, but enclosing the central CCD into the inner
	   src/Lookupradius.h	  radius of the annulus. Thus no counts from the central CCD are taken
	   config/ebkgreg.par	  into account for the background estimate.
				- Include instrument label: PN, M1, M2 in the Source List columns
				- Three new columns included in Source List:
				- Background extraction region shape: CIRCLE or ANNULUS
					- *_RAD1 ( = Circle radius or inner radius for Annulus)
					  *_RAD2 ( = 0 for Circle or outer radius for Annulus)
				- New output parameters for RAD1 and RAD2 (arcsec and detector units)
				- Pixel size set depending on the EPIC camera (pixsizePN = 4.18, pixsizeM1/2 = 1.10)

Version 0.6.2 - 2015-12-21 (JVP)
-----------
	+ No background region is produced if the background extraction radius is less than 3 pixels

Version 0.6.1 - 2015-12-17 (RDS)
-----------
	+ test/ebkgreg_test_pn      - changed test for Boresight_0015.CCF

Version 0.6 - 2015-09-02 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Changed DISTRIBUTION into world

Version 0.5 - 2015-08-21 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Distance between edges of (source region) and (background region) dr0 = 
	  = Source extraction radius, but clamp to 12 arcsec < dr0 < 40 arcsec.

Version 0.4 - 2015-08-13 (JVP)
-----------
	+ In the multiple-sources case from an input Source List
	  the extraction region radius for each source can be obtained from:
	    - Counts and off-axis information from LOOKUP.FITS table
	    or
	    - Directly from the input source list as SRC_RAD column
	+ Documentation updated

Version 0.3 - 2015-08-11 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Open/close dataset correction
	+ GUI layout update

Version 0.2 - 2015-08-04 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Input as Source List file. Background region estimate
	  to the same input file in extra columns (BKG_*).
	+ Input as individual source from the command line. 
	  Background region estimate to stdout.
	+ Documentation.
	
Version 0.1 - 2015-06-16 (JVP)
-----------
	+ Original and Development version
	+ Directory structure created by pkgmaker.
