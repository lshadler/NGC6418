Description
</H1>
The task <TT>catcorr</TT> replaces both <TT>eposcorr</TT> and <TT>evalcorr</TT>, but it
requires another task <TT>catprep</TT> to be run first to extract from the three
reference catalogues a small list of sources in the field of view of the
current observation.  This extracted list is a FITS file which can be made
available as a data product to any user who might wish to run <TT>catcorr</TT>
again with different parameters.

<P>
Since <TT>catcorr</TT> is used in the pipeline before any data quality assessment is 
performed, there is no information on whether the current fields are affected
by problems such as very bright central sources, large extended sources, or 
various telescope artfacts.  
For this reason <TT>catcorr</TT> includes an initial rather basic attempt to detect 
an excess of spurious detections by finding whether any of them lie on what
appear to be straight lines running through the centre of the field.  Such 
lines are usually composed of mostly spurious detections, and so they are
marked internally as of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bad</SPAN> quality and not used in the cross-matching.  
Other detections ignored are those with RADEC_ERR exactly zero (a defect of 
source-finding) or those with RADEC_ERR over 3.0 arc-seconds, 
or with EP_EXTENT above 0.1 arc-seconds.  Unless the number of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">good</SPAN> 
X-ray detections in the list exceeds the minimum specified by parameter 
<TT>mingood</TT> then the correction procedure is abandoned for this observation.

<P>
The matching procedure uses each of the reference catalogues separately: a
statistic is computed which measures the overall goodness of fit between the 
set of XMM detections and the best matching reference source positions, allowing
for the probability of positional coincidences. 
Only a proportion of the XMM sources will have counterparts and of course this 
proportion is unknown.  Provided a reasonable number, perhaps five, appear to 
have counterparts, the following procedure appears to be reliable.
Given the typical densities of X-ray and optical objects there may be a few 
false matches but not enough to affect the results significantly.
The cross-matching 
is repeated while the position of the XMM frame is shifted by small increments
in RA and DEC and rotated slightly about the centre of the field.  A function 
minimisation routine due to Nelder and Mead (Computer Journal, January 1965, 
pp 308-313) is used is used to find the shift and rotation parameters which 
optimise the overall goodness of fit.  This routine is similar in algorithm
to routine AMOEBA which appears in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Numerical Recipes</SPAN>, but the 
routine used here was originally
from Rothamstead Research Establishment.   

<P>
The reference catalogue which
produces the highest maximum goodness of fit is adopted, provided it exceeds 
the minimum fit (parameter <TT>minfit</TT>) and the resulting absolute offset 
measured in arc-seconds does not exceed the parameter <TT>maxoffset</TT>.
This positional shift and rotation are then applied to 
all detetections in the OBSMLI 
file, and two new columns called RA_CORR and DEC_CORR are put in the FITS 
table (or updated if they already exist).  The postion shifts and standard
errors in them, and the goodness of fit, are inserted in the file as FITS headers.
