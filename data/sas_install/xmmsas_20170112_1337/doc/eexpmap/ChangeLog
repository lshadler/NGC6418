ChangeLog for eexpmap
===============================

Version 4.11.1 - 2016-11-14 (AI)
------------	
	+ (src/eexpmap_mod.f90) Initialization to null (at declaration statement) 
	of those pointer that will be used by the CAL to avoid seg fault in gfortran.

Version 4.11 - 2016-07-20 (AI)
------------
	+ (src/eexpmap_mod.f90) compatibility changes with gfortran applied.
	The Bmatrix is passed to C++ with a wrong array descriptor elements (dtype and triplet).
	Only if we create the local variable matrix, we can pass the right values to C++. Not clear 
	why this is happening, we have to keep an eye on it.
	The OAL_toEulerAngles subrotutine has to be called with the matrix transpose. 
	Otherwise, the C++ function handle the matrix elements in the wrong order. We 
	have a similar effect in  rgslib(euler321_mod.f90) module.
	+ (src/Makefile) gfrotran preprocessor macros added.
	
Version 4.10.1 - 2015-12-16 (RDS)
------------
	+ test/expo_refima.fits.gz:

	Changed the template test exposure map back to give the same result as
	the calculation with the old boresight file (XMM_BORESIGHT_0015)

Version 4.10 - 2015-11-30 (RDS)
------------
	+ test/expo_refima.fits.gz:

	Upgraded the template test exposure map to give the same result as 
	the calculation with the new boresight file (XMM_BORESIGHT_0026)

Version 4.9 - 2015-08-25 (RDS)
------------
	+ src/eexpmap_mod.f90: 

	Modified the use of the boresight PSI angle to subtract rather than 
	add. This is only valid if the value in the CCF has a changed sign.
	(SCR-7265)

Version 4.8 - 2014-06-10 (IT)
------------
	+ edetect_io_exp.f90: copy full dataset and array headers of the
	  input image to the exposure map (instead of a list of selected
	  keywords) -> Fixes SPR-7129 and makes physical coordinates
	  available to ds9.
	(copy of version 4.6.6)


Version 4.7 - 2014-04-10 (AI)

Version 4.6.2 - 2010-09-17 (RS)

by moving the CAL_MISCDATA calls outside of the x,y pixel loop.


Version 4.6.1 - 2009-09-22 (HC)
-------------------------------
Extensive bug fixes in the calculation of DETX/Y and X/Y (sky) coordinates
 to closes SOC-SPR-6515.  Exposure maps now match events.
+CAMCOORD2 |-> DETX/Y conversion formulae now match e[mp]events and attcalc.
+Added comments in code + doc re: max attrebin for matching events + expmap.
+No longer ignores very short time bins in attitude data, to match attcalc.
+Now makes the same error rounding negative numbers as does attcalc.
+Now calculates boresight in integer DETX/Y as does attcalc, as opposed
 to the more precise floating-point CAMCOORD2.
+Reverted from CAL_toDirectionCosineMatrix to to old CAL_getBoresightMatrix
 to match attcalc.
+ pixmap_mod.f90: Fixed array index range for user-defined cropped images.
+eexpmap: Resolved confusion over whether integer CAMCOORD2 coordinates
 refer to the centre or the bottom-left corner of CCD pixels.
+eexpmap_mod.f90: Resolved confusion of whether array indices count from 0 or 1.
+eexpmap_mod.f90: Added required CAL_setState call before getting focal length.
+eexpmap_mod.f90: Resolved mix up between CDELT1 and CDELT2.
+eexpmap_mod.f90: Removed unnecessary scaling factor 80 ([xy]sky4, skypixsize).

+config/eexpmap.info: Added epic to GROUPS.
+Doc update on parameter attrebin and blurb on coordinate transformations.

which is allowed in Fortran90.
Close SSC-SPR-3709. 
 
	
Version 4.3 -  2007-10-15 (GL)

Version 3.23.3 (2002-05-22) HB
------------------------------

To avoid excessive memory usage the task automatically switches 
from fast to slow pixelization mode in the rare cases where a large 
number of attitude historgram bins is required due to an unstable 
attitude. In task version 4.21 an error was introduced which resulted
in exposure maps offset by about 1.5 arcmin in these cases.
Corrected in version 3.23.3	

	
Version 3.23.2 (2002-03-05) HB
------------------------------	

Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2797 fails to compile on xmmos03
	
Version 3.23.1 (2002-02-27) HB
------------------------------	

CLOSED SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2792 eexpmap doesn't compile on some machines:	

EXPIDSTR & ATT_SRC propagated from input 	
	
Version 3.23 (2002-01-10) HB
----------------------------

Changes by UL (v3.18) which were missing in version 3.21/22 added again.
	
Version 3.22 (2002-01-09) HB
----------------------------
	
Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2667 parameter badclean not fully explained	
	
Version 3.21 2001-12-03 (A.Finoguenov)
--------------------------------------

- Treatment of PN offset columns added. 

New parameters:
useoffset:bool , default=no (Use information on EPN offset columns)
hducut:real (0<=hducut<=1000), default=0 (Threshold for column offset
                                          selection [channel])


Version 3.20 - 2001-11-22 (JBa)
-------------------------------
- doc/eexpmap_description.tex: fixed documentation


Version 3.19 (2001-11-07)
-------------------------

module edetect_io renamed to edetect_io_exp	
	

Version 3.18 (2001-10-31) - UL
-------------------------
+ brought in line with cal-3.121: type of CAMCOORD/TELCOORD coordinates
  changed from single to double precision

Version 3.17 (2001-10-08)
-------------------------

Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2562 (SPR raised on emldetect-4.2.3). The underlying problem
  was an attitud table which contained NULL values. This resulted
  in an empty exposure map which in turn caused emldetect to crash.
  The SPR was fixed by modifying task eexpmap such that undefined
  attitude values will be ignored and a warning will be issued.
  As of version 4.3 task emldetect will terminate with an error
  message if an empty exposure map is encountered.	 	
	
Version 3.16 (2001-09-12)
-------------------------

Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2550 eexpmap Out of Memory in the pipeline
  The following changes were made:
  *switch from withfastpixelization=yes to withfastpixelization=no
   if there are more than 18 attitude histogram bins
  *prevent the allocation of large arrays which are only needed if
   withfastpixelization=yes in the case withfastpixelization=no  
  *ignore attitude histogram bins which contain less than 1e-4 of the
   total exposure	
	
Version 3.15 (2001-09-05)
-------------------------

- test harness corrected	
	
Version 3.14 (2001-08-30)
-------------------------

- treatment of option withpatterns=yes modified:
  the three cases withpattern=no, withpattern=yes && pattern=" ", and
  withpattern=yes && pattern=<all patterns> (<all patterns> = "0 1" for PN
  and "0 1 ... 31" for MOS) now all result in an exposuremap which has
  QE=1 everywhere. This is different from the previous versions of eexpmap
  where the energy dependence of the QE was folded into the exposure map 
  if withpatterns=yes. In the new version, dividing source counts by an
  exposuremap created for the appropriate patterns will result in rates
  which are normalized to the optical axis (i.e., vignetting corrected)
  and to the <all patterns> case.	

Closed SPR:
+ SSC-SPR-2544 Exposure in detector coordinates should not depend on pixel size	
	
Version 3.13.2 (2001-07-25)

Version 3.13 (2001-05-22)
--------------------------

-------------
      + patched version by G. Vacanti
      + (src/Makefile) remove calcxx calf90 from USEDLIBS as this caused segm
entation faults in metatasks. cal is enough anyway.


Version 2.5 (September 16, 1999)
--------------------------------

- task now reads attitude file format as generated by task atthkgen
	
	
Version 2.4 (July 12, 1999)
---------------------------	

- parameter names changed to conform to conventions

closed SPR: 

 - 01030: test-harness corrected

Version 2.2 & 2.3
----------------------	

- minor corrections

	
Version 2.1
----------------------
	
- program now accepts input images of arbitrary size.
- program expects one GTI extension per chip (PN:12; MOS:7).
  The program als o produces useful output if only one or no
  GTI extension is present.	
- output is written as primary FITS image.
- the test harness now uses 320 x 320 pixel test images. 
  The task distribution .tgz file is thus much smaller.

  (3) CAL routines for CCD quantum efficiency, vignetting, and 
      filter transmission	
	
Closed SPRs:

 - 0077: cp_head moved to new module edetect_io which will be used
