ChangeLog for omregion	
======================
Version 2.14.1 - 2016-01-12 (AI) 
------------------------------
	+(src/omregion_mod.f90)  New NAGFor compiler 6.2 throws an Overflow exception 
	for some integer values. To solve this problem we have added two new null Int8 and Int16 
	definitions.

Version 2.14 - 2012-11-30 (VNY) 
------------------------------
	+(src/omregion_mod.f90): Added the capability of picking up
	the columns from the combined and merged source lists 
	produced by the tasks omsrclistcomb and ommergelists
Version 2.13 - 2012-11-30 (VNY) 
------------------------------
	+(src/omregion_mod.f90):
	Replaced the source column names from RA, DEC to RA_CORR, 
	DEC_CORR to get the region file corresponding to the 
	astrometry-corrected source positions.
Version 2.12 - 2012-11-30 (VNY) 
------------------------------
	+(src/omregion_mod.f90):
 	Introduced the possibility for creating a region file 
	for sky images in the OM Imaging mode.
Version 2.11.2 - 2010-03-14 (VNY)
--------------------------------	
	+(src/omregion_mod.f90): 
	Protected against the possibility of duplication of 
	the main source (SSC-SPR-6601). In the case the distance between 
	the main and contaminating sources is less than 3 pixels, 
	the avoiding source is considered to be a duplicate and, thus, is not
        included into the output region file
Version 2.11.1 - 2007-06-22 (VNY)
-------------------------------	
	+/test/checkoutput.f90 
	To fix SSC-SPR-3684 the running of the code checkoutput.f90
	is suppressed since it was doing quite unimportant checks, but
	casusing a problem on the Mac computer.
Version 2.11 - 2003-11-21 (VNY)
-------------------------------	
	DEPEND file updated to match the new
	version (3.0) of ssclib
Version 2.10 - 2003-07-16 (VNY)
------------------------------	
	(+/src/omregion_mod.f90, +/test/checkoutput.f90) A small mistake 
	is corrected, which was producing one-pixel shift 
	of the source region with respect to the source position given 
	by OMDETECT (SSC-SPR-3138)
	
Version 2.9 - 2002-09-26 (VNY)
-----------------------------
	DEPEND file has been updated (dependence on sas-1.312 included)
	
Version 2.8 - 2002-06-10
        (VNY) - +(config/omregion.info) GROUP parameter
 	is set to 'om pipeline' instead of previous 'pipeline'
Version 2.7 - 13.05.2002 (VNY) - DEPEND and +/src/omregion.par files
	are updated in order to work with new PARAM-2.0
Version 2.6.4 - 09.05.2002 (VNY) - ChangeLog-file corrected	
Version 2.6.3 - 14/03/2002 (CB) (+/doc/omregion_description.tex) 
	Documentation corrected.
Version 2.6.2 - 28/01/2002 (VNY)
	(+/config/omregion.par) - meanings for the obligatory and optional
	parameters have been updated.
Version 2.6.1 - 28/01/2002 (VNY) 
	(+/src/omregion_mod.f90): the output background extraction area is
	analysed from the point of view of its size. If neighbour sources
	in the vicinity of the target have large avoiding circles, the
	background extraction area could became too small or even of zero
	size. In this case EVSELECT, which uses the region expression 
	created by OMREGION, will not extract background events. In order
	to avoid this situation, OMREGION task, analyses the background area and, in
	the case of its being smaller than 100, attempts to reduce the
	contaminating source's radius down to 6 pixels or, if there are
	no contaminating sources nearby, OMREGION produces a warning
	message (SSC-SPR-2702).	
Version 2.6 - 08/01/2002 (VNY)
	(DEPEND): dependencies file has been updated to work with higher
	version of ssclib (2.0)
Version 2.5 - 12.12.2001 (VNY)
	(+/src/omregion_mod.f90): the radius for the avoiding circles
	is taken from the input parameter "srcradius" for the case if
	it is negative. This permits to improve the exposure-to-exposure
	stability of the output lightcurves. The avoiding circle radius
	within the background area is set to abs(srcradius). If the
	avoiding circle is within the source area, it is set
	to 0.8*abs(srcradius).
Version 2.4 - 10.12.2001 (VNY)
	(+/src/omregion_mod.f90):  possible contamination of the source
	extraction area by a neighbour source is fixed:
	avoiding circles have been added to the source region table
        (similar to the avoiding circles in the background extraction
	area), SSC-SPR-2669.
Version 2.3.1: - 18 October 2001 (VNY)
	Dependencies have been updated to rectify the task build.
	No srcRadius reduction applied when another
	source is in the vicinity of the target (only for the case when
	the srcradius parameter is negative, and only for the FAST mode)
Version 2.3: - 07 August 2001 (VNY)
	the meaning of the "srcradius" parameter has been changed: now it is in pixels if it is negative.
        In this case the radius is taken fixed as ABS(SRCRADIUS). If the paraneter 
        is positive, its meaning is as before, i.e. the radius of the source region 
        expressed in the units of FWHMs. 
Version 2.2.1 - 27 July 2001 (VNY)
    DESCRIPTION keyword has been added in the omregion.info file

Version 2.2: - 28 May 2001 (VNY)
	variables with the OSW origin have been added (window0, windowX0, windowY0, windowX1, windowY1);
        necessary attributes have been added to the source and background region tables;
        windowX0 and windowY0 have been added to the coordinates of the avoid circle.

	
Version 2.1: - 05 October (CB)
	Added miising info file.
