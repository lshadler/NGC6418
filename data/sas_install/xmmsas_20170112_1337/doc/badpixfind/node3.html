Description
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="571"></A><A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="../badpixfind/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">badpixfind</SPAN></A>
searches for pixels identified as containing no useful
data, and uses this information to produce an output file. This output file
can then be used by the task <A NAME="575"></A><A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="../badpix/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">badpix</SPAN></A>
to append the information to the
events file. A bad pixel map (or mask) can also be produced. 

<P>
An important point regarding the bad pixels is that there are essentially
<EM>three separate</EM> (though not exclusive) sets of bad pixels that must be
dealt with. These are (1) the bad pixels uplinked to the satellite and
eliminated on-board, (2) the bad pixels identified in the 
Current Calibration File (CCF) but not uplinked,
and (3) the bad pixels associated with the particular observation in question.
<A NAME="579"></A><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="../badpixfind/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">badpixfind</SPAN></A>
searches for this third set of bad pixels, which may of 
course, contain within it part (or all) of the other two sets.

<P>
There are two modes to <A NAME="583"></A><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="../badpixfind/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">badpixfind</SPAN></A>. Mode&nbsp;1 involves all the searching
and statistical techniques and makes up the bulk of the task. 
Within mode&nbsp;1 (<TT>searchbadpix</TT>='Y', [=default]), the user can search for...

<P>
<B>1</B> Hot and dead pixels. The user is able to specify maximum and minimum
allowed values (via the parameters <TT>lothresh</TT> and <TT>hithresh</TT>) to
screen for hot and dead pixels. These threshold
levels can be input (via the parameter <TT>thresholdlabel</TT>) in terms of
number of counts, count rate, or percentages of the peak value in the dataset.
In cases of supposed hot pixels, the pixel in question and its neighbours are
compared with the local PSF to check whether the pixel is
genuinely 'hot' or may be due to a source [see comments]. Here the user can set
the <TT>cellsize</TT> of the box around the hot pixel to be compared with the
PSF (total box width = twice <TT>cellsize</TT> +1). Here, known uplinked
bad pixels and previously found bad pixels are removed from the PSF
comparison. The user can also set the parameter <TT>narrowerthanpsf</TT>. This
is a measure of how much more compact the pixel and its neighbours are when
compared with the PSF (1 means of similar width, greater than 1 means that
feature is narrower than the PSF, and hence likely a bad pixel [if
<TT>narrowerthanpsf</TT> is set to zero, the PSF comparison is removed and all
hot features, whether sources, bad pixels or whatever, can be found]).
Essentially, <TT>narrowerthanpsf</TT> is the ratio A/B, where A is the ratio of
the target (bad) pixel to the total (twice <TT>cellsize</TT> +1 by twice
<TT>cellsize</TT> +1) square, and B is the equivalent for the PSF. The user may
also set a <TT>backgroundrate</TT> (ct/s/pix) here. A negative value indicates
that the mean value over the whole field is to be calculated and used. In
cases where very bright, extended sources exist (and thus the mean is not too
representative of the true background mean), a typical <TT>backgroundrate</TT>
value should be given (see comments).

<P>
<B>2</B> Hot and dead whole columns (channels)
(<TT>withsearchbadcolumn</TT>='Y'). Here a column may appear bad because of a
small number of individual pixels that are bad (these perhaps, depending on
the threshold levels, being detected by the previously described part of the
task), or it may be bad because the entire column as a whole appears bad. Via
the parameter <TT>columnsearchlabel</TT>, one can specify whether the minimum
and maximum <EM>column</EM> threshold values (<TT>locolthresh</TT> &amp;
<TT>hicolthresh</TT>) refer to the total counts/count rate of the column or to
the median value within each column. The median choice is more sensitive to
finding bad whole columns with no particularly bad pixels within them. Again,
the threshold levels can be input (via the parameter <TT>thresholdlabel</TT>)
in terms of number of counts, count rate, or percentages of the peak value in
the dataset.

<P>
<B>3</B> Flickering pixels. The parameter <TT>flickertimesteps</TT> sets the
number of `timesteps' into which the dataset can be split (if
<TT>flickertimesteps</TT> is set to 1, no attempt is made to seach for
flickering pixels). Here, each pixel is searched for significant variations.
In the case of low count pixels, the distribution of counts per timestep is
compared with a Poisson distribution, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is
applied. Pixels with a KS-statistic above the input threshold
<TT>flickerksthresh</TT> are deemed flickering. In the high count pixel case, a
chi-squared statistic about the mean counts per timestep is calculated. Pixels
with a reduced chi-squared statistic above the input threshold
<TT>flickerchisqthresh</TT> are deemed flickering. [see comments]

<P>
The whole of mode&nbsp;1 above can be performed between user-defined energy bands, 
via the parameters <TT>loenergythresh</TT> and <TT>hienergythresh</TT> (in keV). 
Also, the high threshold values <TT>hithresh</TT> and <TT>hicolthresh</TT> can 
(in the <TT>thresholdlabel</TT> = COUNTS or RATE cases) refer to either a total 
count or countrate value or to a count or countrate value above the (either
set or calculated) background (<TT>backgroundrate</TT>). This choice is set via
the parameter <TT>threshabovebackground</TT>.

<P>
Within mode&nbsp;2 of <A NAME="616"></A><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="../badpixfind/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">badpixfind</SPAN></A>, 
the user can explicitly flag invalid pixels or sets of pixels via the list
parameters <TT>rawxlist</TT>, <TT>rawylist</TT>, <TT>typelist</TT> and
<TT>yextentlist</TT>. 

<P>
After searching for pixels which may contain double (or more) entries, and 
warning the user thereof, a final output file is constructed, containing for
each bad pixel (or, to be precise, for each set (in RAWY-extension) of bad
pixels), the position RAWX/RAWY, any extent in the Y direction, and the type
of fault; 1 Hot, 2 Flickering, 3 Dead. 
Statistics as to the input file values are provided also
by the task, before and after the individual sections of the task.

<P>
A badpixfind map may be produced via the parameter <TT>withbadpixmap</TT>. Here
an image is formed whereby bad pixels (and if desired, surrounding neighbours
[chosen via the parameter <TT>mappixcellsize</TT>]) are assigned a value of zero, good
pixels a value of one. This map includes the pixels found by the current
<A NAME="626"></A><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="../badpixfind/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">badpixfind</SPAN></A>
run, and the XMM-uplinked bad pixels contained within the
CCF. Furthermore, regions outside the field of view (FOV) can be set to zero 
in the map via the parameter <TT>withfovmask</TT>. 
This map can be used in <A NAME="631"></A><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="../evselect/index.html"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">evselect</SPAN></A>
to select images, spectra or time
series with these pixels ignored (e.g. to produce a background [source and bad
pixel/column-removed] lightcurve).
