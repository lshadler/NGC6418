Version 3.23.1 - 2003-12-12 (JSH)
------------
	+ Fix Makefiles in New odfingest to fix bizarre run-time error caused
	by order of libraries in link phase of dynamic build. No, don't ask.

Version 3.23 - 2003-11-12 (JSH)
------------
	+ (TestTimeRows.cc) Catch end() used in first test, don't print 
	end() results in second test.
	+ (HkparameterTest.cc) Modify duration to process to match reality

Version 3.22 - 2003-08-29 (GV)
------------
	+ (TimeRows.cc) Get rid of a message that was being printed 100's
	of times without being informative.
	+ (new) test harnesses: adjust a couple of constructors that had
	the wrong signature after Hkparameter had been changed.
	
Version 3.21 - 2003-08-26 (GV)
------------
	+ Several fixes to nodfingest, test harnesses extended to cover
	the problems that showed up in testing.
	
Version 3.20 - 2003-06-10 (GV)
------------
	+ ( Hkparameter_Descriptor.h) Parameter K1211 was incorrectly
	assigned to MOS1 instead of MOS2.

Version 3.19 - 2003-05-13 (GV)
------------
	+ Add CMCORR parameters for PN (F1525/1625/1725/1825).
	
Version 3.18 - 2003-05-07 (GV)
------------
	+ Add parameter MEAN_TEMPERATURE (E/K 1311) for MOS.
	
Version 3.17 - 2003-05-06 (GV)
------------
	+ Add next-generation odfingest, temporarily called nodfingest.
	
Version 3.16 - 2003-02-21 (GV)
------------
	+ (odfingest.cc) Make the name of the summary file available to
	calling meta-tasks.
	
Version 3.15 - 2002-10-14 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/*.cc) remove a few remaining dts::ends that were apparently
	confusing selectlib (SOC-SPR-2350).

Version 3.14 - 2002-09-17 (GV)
------------
	+ (testtot.cc) include <cmath> so that it compiles on gcc-2.96.

Version 3.13 - 2002-09-16 (GV)
------------
	+ Misc. source/header adjustments for gcc-3.1
	
Version 3.12 - 2002-07-09 (GV)
------------
	+ Restore DEPEND.
	
Version 3.11 - 2002-07-08 (GV)
------------
	+ DEPEND updated.
	
Version 3.10 - 2002-05-17 (GV)
------------
	+ updated for param 2.0

Version 3.9 - 2002-05-17 (GV)
-----------
	+ (OdfObject.cc) make the messages about missing CONFIGURATIOn or
	PROPOSAL record more explicit.
	
Version 3.8 - 2002-04-10 (GV)
-----------
	+ (OdfObject.cc::proposal_summary_rec) Change how the PROPOSAL
	record is read from the original SUM.ASC file. This should make it
	more robust against those cases when the line of text containing
	the word PROPOSAL contains characters other than blank. SOC-SPR-2286.
	+ A missing CONFIGURATION record in the SUM.ASC is no longer a
	warning, only a message.

Version 3.7.5 - 2002-03-18 (GV)
-------------
	+ Test harness against DCP 141 updated (odfconf). Relevant section
	  was actually commented out.

Version 3.7.4 - 2002-03-05 (GV)
-------------
 	+ (IppvImplementation.cc) When no translation from a value to
 	string is found, IppvCommon::print writes UNDEFINED instead of
 	NoTranslation in the summary file.
 	+ (OdfObject.cc:proposal_summary_rec()) copy the SUM.ASC into the
 	SUM.SAS from the PROPOSAL section or, if present, the new
 	CONFIGURATION section (SOC RCR 638, ODF ICD DCP	141).

Version 3.7.3 - 2002-02-27 (UL)
-------------
	+ fixed problem with incorrect Dal usage in test/testtot.cc
	  (caused test failure under Linux)

Version 3.7.2 - 2002-02-14 (GV)
-------------
	+ (IppvImplementation.cc) setValue() tolerates one HK record with
	a different value than expected. In a few cases in fact (for
	instance 0102/0099020301, PNS012) the value for F1118 (FILTER)
	changes just for 8s to CLOSE (it was MEDIUM). Consider this a
	glitch in tm, and carry on.
	+ (OdfObject.cc) DLI and DII files are now given an arbitrary
	duration of 1s instead of 4m as before. Giving them 4m may
	make exposures with both science and DLI/DII file too long -> HK
	extraction fails (see: 0101/0124710301, PNU002).
	
Version 3.7.1 - 2002-01-28 (GV)
-------------
	+ (OdfObject.cc) change tpad to 240s (was 90). There are two 
	consequences:
	   . the default arbitrary exposure duration for some type of
	   exposures becomes 480s (it is coded as 2*tpad).
	   . read the HK values from Tstart(exposure) + 240s  to
	   Tstop(exposure) - 240s
	
Version 3.7 - 2002-01-24 (GV)
-----------
	+ (IppvExtractionImplementation.cc) Add GAIN_CCD for MOS. This
	required also the addition of EmosGainTranslator.
	
Version 3.6 - 2002-01-17 (GV)
-----------
	+ ((OdfObject.cc) handle the case when DLI + science mode data are
	present in the same exposure, by giving priority to the science
	data. 

Version 3.5 - 2002-01-14 (GV)
-----------
	+ (IppvExtractionImplementation.c) PN CAMEX_GAIN for CCD4 should
	have used F1234 instead of F1243.

Version 3.4 - 2002-01-07 (GV)
-----------
	+ (OdfObject.cc::scan) Modify slightly the algorithm used when
	DATE-END is not a valid time string. A dataset with an invalid
	DATE-END used to be assigned an arbitrary duration of 180s. But
	there are cases (mostly ODFs from the real time chain) that can
	have an invalid DATE-END and contain good data. Now the algorithm
	will, if possible, set DATE-END to be the time of the last record
	in the main HK dataset.
	+ (IppvExtractionImplementation.cc) Add CAMEX_GAIN_CCDx for PN
	(SOC-SPR-2154). Doc updated.
	
Version 3.3 - 2001-11-15 (GV)
-----------
	+ re-upload of 3.2.8 with new version number for reltrack.
	
Version 3.2.9 - 2001-11-15 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) undo the i/f changes on OdfSet (3.2.4) so
	that it can work with oal as in SAS 5.2.0. NOTE: DEPEND cannot be
	updated meaningfully because we have oal-3.68.6 in SAS 5.2.0 and
	the interface change happened at oal-3.68.8 (as of today in
	release track).
	
Version 3.2.8 - 2001-11-06 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) Now also cope correctly with the case of TIE
	+ NOI/ODI, neglected during the previous updates.
	
Version 3.2.7 - 2001-11-02 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) cope 'correctly' with the case of both NOI and
	IME data files in the same PN exposure.
	+ SLEW identification: 9RRRR#####, but not 99999#####, as these
	are unscheduled observations.
	
Version 3.2.6 - 2001-10-30 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc:scan) impose fixed duration for RGS DII
	exposures, as DATE-END is not reliable.
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc::scan) determine latest possible DATE-END from
	instrument HK. If DATE-END from any dataset appears to be later
	than what reported in HK, use the value from the HK instead.
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc:scan) catch STime errors when evaluating
	DATE-END. If an error occurs, set DATE-END to be start + 180s.
	+ (OdfObject::observation_rec) write SLEW instead of OBSERVATION
	in the summary file if the observation identifier starts with a 9.
	+ (OdfObject::configuration_sub_record) do not use any of the OM
	auxiliary datasets in the determination of the instrument mode.
	+ (OdfObject.cc) cope 'correctly' with the case of both ODI and
	IME data files in the same PN exposure.
	
Version 3.2.5 - 2001-10-30 (GV)
-------------
	+ (calmode.cc) here too I should have adjusted the i/f to OdfSet.
	+ (OdfObject.cc)  remove condition whereby the cal was asked to
	identify the mode only if the dataset was science-related. This to
	increase the amount of information in the summary file (and hence
	in the ODF d/b and odfbrowser).
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc:observation_rec) if there are no science files
	in the ODF, then try to determine the observation duration from
        the HK files. SOC-SPR-2094. This also required a change in scan(),
        where the ODFcan now also be identified from the names of the HK
        files. 
	+ (src/IppvTranslator.cc:EpnFilterWheelTranslator) All CAL
        positions are identified as Xmm::FILTER_NONE instead of the
        arbitrary "CalibrationPosition" that was breaking the
        OAL. SOC-SPR-2114.     

Version 3.2.4 - 2001-10-26 (GV)
-------------
	+ OdfObject.cc: adjust how OdfSet is created, as the OAL in the
	reltrack decided to change this interface (!).
	+ DEPEND updated accordingly.
	
Version 3.2.3 - 2001-10-09 (GV)
-------------
	+ Fix doco: parameter oalcheck defaults to no (SOC-SPR-2193).
	
Version 3.2.2 - 2001-10-05 (GV)
-------------
	+ (OdfObject.cc) when determining the OM instrument mode, ask to
	window 0 instead of window 1, otherwise the mode determination
	fails when there is only one OM window (SOC-SPR-2195).
	
Version 3.2.1 - 2001-07-18 (UL)
-------------
	+ fixed problem with too fragile test test/testtot.cc (see comments)

Version 3.2 - 2001-07-12 (GV)
-----------
	+(src/TimeOrderedTble.cc) When the table is constructed time
	strings that cannot be translated to a valid time are
	ignored. That means that a TOT could have less rows than the table
	it was constructed from. A new method (validTimes) introduced to
	report on the number of good time entries. When a time is accessed
	through time_of_row(k), the k is mean to refer to the orginal
	table instead of the TOT. This fixes SOC-SPR-2095, in relation
	to ODF 0061_0122700201. 
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) during the calculation of the OM exposure
	start/stop make sure to check that the TIME column in the NPHK
	file is valid (SOC-SPR-2095).
	+ (src/IppvImplementation.cc::setValue) if the value of a
	parameter changes during the exposure and that parameter is
	supposed to be constant, write the record number and the table
	name in the warning message, to make visual checking easier.
	
Version 3.1.1 - 2001-06-08 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/odfingest.cc) Change the manner of setting the target ODF
	directory. If the directory is given on the command line, use that
	value, else ask the OAL (that'll read it through SAS_ODF or
	--odf). This prevents the OAL from being activated when it is not
	the user intention (SOC-SPR-2088). Also check that writing to the
	output file completes correctly (SOC-SPR-2089).
	+ (doc/odingest_description.tex) updated with the new error
	condition.
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) use 'window' and not CCD when referring to OM
	(SOC-SPR-1969). 
	
	
Version 3.1 - 2001-05-18 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/IppvTranslator.cc) EpnFilterWheelTranslator<string> maps HK
	names to CAL filter names.
	+ (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) F1118 is now used to
	determine the filter. Introduce FILTER_POTENTIOMETER to monitor
	what the old algorithm does.
	+ (src/odfingest_description.tex) updated.

Version 3.0 - 2001-05-08 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) FILTER_WHEEL_POSITION is
	now constrained with "F1120 == ACTIVE && F1119 == STOPPED".
	+ (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) MOS CLOCK_RESET_TIME_*
	should have been treated as periodic parameters instead of
	non-periodic (SOC-SPR-2035).
	+ (doc/odfingest_description.tex) regenerate the documentation of
	the parameters to take into account PN filter changes. 
	
Version 2.2.1 - 2001-05-07 (GV)
-------------
	+ (doc/odfingest_description.tex) use appropriate macros to refer
	to the cal and the oal.
	+ (tools/calmode.cc) change the output format.
	
Version 2.2 - 2001-04-04 (UL)
-----------
	+ brought in line with caloalutils-1.47
	  (Xmm::ATTITUDE -> Xmm::ATTITUDE_HISTORY)
	+ updated old-style include statements

Version 2.1 - 2001-04-02 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/IppvTranslator.cc) EpnFilterWheelTranslator now recognizes
	also the string 'NO STOP POS.' (final `.') after somebody decided
	to fix the puntuation of the ODF HK (SOC-SPR-1974).
	+ (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) fix typo in error message.
	
Version 2.0 - 2001-03-19 (GV)
-----------
	+ (src/odfingest.cc) by default use the ODF pointed to by
	SAS_ODF. This is in SAS-SCR-0038.
	+ (config/odfingest.par) introduce --withodfdir (default = no).
	+ (config/odfingest.lyt) use it.
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) allow OM to have IMI + FAE combinations
	(SOC-SPR-1940). 
	
Version 1.0.9 - 2001-02-05 (GV)
-------------
	+ SOC-SPR-1907:
	  - (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) in function hkname change
	  the check d.size !=1 to d.size > 1. That is, it is ok to have 0
	  or 1 HK files, but it is not ok to have more than 1.

Version 1.0.8 - 2001-01-29 (GV)
-------------
	+ SOC-SPR-1907:
	  - (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) check if required HK file
	  exists. If not issue a warning, set all HK parameters to
	  unknown, and continue.
	+ SOC-SPR-1908:
	  - (src/IppvExtractor*): add _label data member. In OdfObject.cc
	  the label is set to instrument/exposure, so that warning
	  messages from the HK extraction process can be made clearer.
	  - (src/IppvImplementation.cc) HK file and table name,
	  sought time entry, and available time range are given in the
	  warning messages.
	+ SOC-SPR-1909:
	  - (src/IppvImplementation.*) warning about new parameter value
	  changed into an exception throw.
	  - (src/Ippv.h) add exception ParameterChange.
	+ SOC-SPR-1910:
	  - (src/OdfObject.*) introduce _tpad;
	  - (src/OdfObject.*) introduce _no_ippv_modes, a list of data
	  modes that are not considered when extracting IPPVs. For
	  instance: Discarded Lines Images.
	+ (doc/odfingest_description.tex) updates required by the changes
	above. 
	+ SOC-SPR-1915:
	  - (src/OdfObject.cc) use cmodes.clear() and not cmodes.empty()
	  (same for dmodes. Former erases all elements, latter checks if
	  there are any elements. This prevented odfingest from correctly
	  writing MODE = UNDEFINED when data files of more than one type
	  where found in one exposure.
	
Version 1.0.7 - 2000-12-15 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) remove assertions (that are triggered by bad
	ODFs more often then they should) and replace them with
	errors. Same result, but one gets an error message now. SOC-SPR-1864.
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) introduce member _valid, to indicate whether
	a directory scan returned a non empty list of ODF constituents.
	+ (src/odfingest.cc) use _valid to prevent segfault and unfriendly
	message (SOC-SPR-1855).
	+ (doc/odfingest_description.tex) update list of warnings.
	

Version 1.0.6 - 2000-11-16 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/IppvTranslator.cc) change position of calthin1 filter for PN
	 fromm 113.85 to 110.65, where it should have always been!

Version 1.0.5 - 2000-11-13 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) make DLI duration 60s.
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) add/subtract 90s (instead of 60) to
	DAT-OBS/END when considering  the exposure time range over which
	HK parameters are to be extracted (SOC-SPR-1833).
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) calculate observation duration more
	accurately (SOC-SPR-1831).
	
Version 1.0.4 - 2000-11-09 (GV)
-------------
	+ (odfingest.lyt) filled in.

Version 1.0.3 - 2000-11-08 (GV)
-------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc): when determining the observation duration,
	treat the PN discarded lines data sets in a different manner,
	assigning and arbitray duration of 120s to each of them. This to
	prevent making the observation unrealistically long (the discarded
	lines data sets have the wrong DATE-END, often several hours later
	than the actual observation end time).

Version 1.0.2 - 2000-10-16 (GV)
-------------
	+ (IppvImplementation.cc) add explicit instantiations to satisfy
	linker on DEC/OSF (SOC-SPR-1765).
	
Version 1.0.1 - 2000-10-13 (GV)
-------------
	+ add parameter oalcheck (true by default). The newly created
	summary file is passed on to the OAL. This guarantees that the
	summary file can be parsed by the OAL. Also, a number of rough
	sanity checks are performed: existence of attitude, time
	correlation, and orbit file.
	+ change name to the LOWER_THRESHOLD_Qy_CCDx parameters, as
	requested by MPE. x=0,1,2 now.
	
Version 1.0 - 2000-10-06 (GV)
-----------
	+ approved.
	+ exposure start/end for OM now relies on SID=148/149 instead of
	dates in DATE-OBS DATE-END.
	
Version 0.18 - 2000-09-29 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/IppvTranslator.cc) in line with new Xmm::* names for the
	PN-related filters.

Version 0.17 - 2000-09-29 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) also ask the cal server to be silent about
	being unable to match the FILTER. This is required because the OM
	data files have since ODS 10.2.3 a FILTER attribute, but this
	attribute is the hardware value (a number) and not a cal-friendly
	string. 

Version 0.16 - 2000-09-26 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/odfingest.cc) now remove ODF (SUM.ASC) file from the file
	list to remove an ambiguity for the OAL.
	+ (src/OdfObject.*) add removeFile(string) to implement the
	above. Method icdosf() was private is now public.

Version 0.15 - 2000-09-25 (GV)
------------
	+ review the instrument mode determination code.
	+ doc updated and extended.

Version 0.14 - 2000-09-22 (GV)
------------
	+ make instrument determination optional
	(findinstrumentmodes=no). When mode determination is switched off
	odfingest does not need a CIF.
	+ make ippv extraction optional (usehousekeeping=no). When ippv
	extraction is switched off odfingest does not need any HK files.
	+ make use of new cal interface to set state without issuing a
	warning, then intercept the condition mode->isUncertain(). Issue a
	warning and set the mode to unknown.

Version 0.13 - 2000-09-19 (GV)
------------
	+ implement PN filter translation from potentiometer readout to
	string.
	+ fix translation of PN fileter wheel name, as ODF ICD contained a
	typo (FILTRA-THIN should have been FILTRA-THIN1). Expect more of
	these.
	+ when translation cannot be made, issue warning instead of
	aborting.
	+ Ippv class can now be told _not_ to check that a parameter value
	remains constant throughout the exposure. This is used for the
	EPIC clock RESET times: here we're interested in the value when
	the exposure start and we don't care if the value changes during
	the exposure, as this change is normal for exposures lasting more
	than 2^15s.
	+ Ippv: real32 version calculates the mean of the parameter over
	the exposure instead of taking the first value. This is used to
	calculate the mean position of the PN filter wheel. This value is
	then translated to a string.
	
Version 0.12 - 2000-09-18 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/IppvExtractorImplementation.cc) start looking for IPPVs
	from tstart + 60s to tstop - 60s. This is to make sure that when
	we look the relevant telemetry packets have been received.

Version 0.11 - 2000-09-18 (GV)
------------
	+ (src/OdfObject.cc) improve camera mode, ccd mode determination
	algorithm. 

Version 0.10 - 2000-09-18 (GV)
------------
	+ add CCD/camera mode string to the IPPV list
	(via CAL, hence it now requires SAS_CCF to be set). Look for MODE
	= in the summary file. 
	+ (config/odfingest.par) usecanonicalname=yes by default.
	
Version 0.9 - 2000-09-15 (GV)
-----------
