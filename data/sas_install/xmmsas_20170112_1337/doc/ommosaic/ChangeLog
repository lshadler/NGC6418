	file. Exposure image corrected for dead-time fraction.
	

Version 1.21 - 2008-09-18 (VNY) +src/ommosaic_mod.f90: The subroutine 
	RemoveGaps is corrected to prevent interpolating and filling 
	the corners between two images instead of filling in the gaps.
	The file name in the message produced by the task is shorten
	(the task message was too long and estetically not very nice
	because of the long path included into the file name).
Version 1.20 - 2008-08-01 (VNY) A half-pixel shift in the coordinates
 	of the reference pixel CRPIX1 and CRPIX2 of the output sky-image
	is removed. This shift was always there (introduced by the 
	subroutine calculateOutputSize.
Version 1.19 - 2008-07-09 (VNY) The name of the attribute RA_PNT 
	in the header of the input image file is corrected in the subroutine
	ModifyAstrometryAttributes (erroneously was DEC_PNT). 
	This attribute is changed only when the astrometry correction
	was not applied to the image before running ommosaic.
Version 1.18 - 2008-04-17 (VNY) Introducing the keyword POSINTRP
	(false/true) to indicathe whether the the astrometric correction
	was done by omatt (using the catalogue) or by interpolation
	(using the coorections from other exposures belonging
	to the data set). The input images are now astrometry-
	corrected (shifted) in the case they were not corrected
	by omatt. In this case the interpolated correction is used.
Version 1.17 - 2008-04-17 (VNY) interpolating the RA and DEC offsets
	for those exposures that were not astrometry corrected
	taking the offsets from the corrected exposures. Making
	use of the RA_OFF and DEC_OFF attributes produced by omatt
	(this is a continuation of updates for fixing SSC-SPR-3707).
Version 1.16 - 2008-03-11 (VNY) The RA shifts of the individual images
        that form the mosaic are multiplied by cos(DEC), SSC-SPR-3710  
Version 1.15 - 2008-03-07 (VNY) 
	Documentation updated
Version 1.14 - 2008-02-27 (VNY)
	Making use of the keyword POSCOROK for astrometry-corrected
	images and shifting these images according to the CRVAL1 and CRVAL2
	keywords (SSC-SPR-3707)
Version 1.13 - 2007-03-05 (CB) 
-------------------------
       
        Ammended info file to OM.
