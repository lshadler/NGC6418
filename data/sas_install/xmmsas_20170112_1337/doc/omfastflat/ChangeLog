ChangeLog for omfastflat
===============================
Version 1.21 - 2011-10-04 (VNY) +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90)
	Further improvements of the calculation of the mod-8 factor
	by excluding the source region from calculations
Version 1.20 - 2011-09-29 (VNY) +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90)
	Improved the calculation of the mod-8 modulation factor 
	by removing the first and the last raws and columns 
	from the analysis (as these raws and columns are 
	likely to be affected by the tracking shifts
Version 1.19.2 - 2010-03-24 (VNY) +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90)
	Improved the calculation of the mod-8 modulation factor
	(fixing SSC-SPR-6604), which was overestimated for some
	of the Fast-window images due to the source size and 
	position. 
Version 1.19.1 - 2010-03-11 (VNY)  +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90)
	Fixing a bug related to the usage of pointers, which 
	was affecting the calculation of the mod-8 modulation factor
        (ssc-spr-6599). Also increasing the threshold from 0.25 to 0.35
	for the exposure flagging when it is affected by the mod-8 noise  
	in order to avoid possible sudden increases of the source extraction 
	radius for moderately mod-8 corrupted exposures. 
Version 1.19 - 2010-01-31 (VNY) +(ChangeLog) two misprints
	are corrected.
Version 1.18 - 2010-01-26 (VNY) +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90) 
	A new keyword is introduced into the output file header
	(MOD8FACTOR). Its value changes from 0 to 1 and indicated
	the degree of mod-8 modulation of the image.
Version 1.17 - 2009-04-05 (VNY) +(DEPEND) Removed the dependency
	on ssclib to avoid build failure.
Version 1.16.2 - 2007-06-07 (VNY) +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90) Introducing 
	analysis of the image as to the possible modulo-8 and coincidence
	loss corruption. 
	Setting the new flag MOD8FLAG to 1 to indicate the possible 
	corruption, otherwise the flag is set to 0 (fixing 
	SPR-3144)
Version 1.16.1 - 2007-06-06 (VNY) +(src/omfastflat_mod.f90) A check is
	introduced to make sure that when creating a new column in the data 
	table of the event-list file this column does not exist. This
	might possibly cause a crash when rinning the task twice on the
	same data set (SSC-SPR-3667)
Version 1.16 - 2003-11-21 (VNY) DEPEND file updated (to match the new 
	version (3.0) of ssclib
Version 1.15 - 2002-09-26 (VNY) DEPEND file updated (dependence on 
	SAS-1.312 is introduced)
Version 1.14 - 2002-06-10
        (VNY) +(config/omfastflat.info) GROUP parameter
	set to 'om pipeline' instead of 'pipeline'
Version 1.13 13/05/2002 (VNY) DEPEND and +config/omfastflat.par files
	in order to work with new PARAM-2.0
Version 1.12.1 26/03/2002 (CB) DISTRIBUTION changed to world
Version 1.12 08/01/2002 (VNY) DEPEND file ammended
Version 1.11 14/12/2001 (VNY) Prepared for a new SAS release
Version 1.10.7 25/10/2001  A bug with the use of factorP pointer has been
 fixed which caused test-harness in the omdetect task. 
Version 1.10.6 24/10/2001  pointers to window parameters (windowX0P, windowY0P, windowDXP, windowDYP)
 were replaced with int32 variables in the cases when these parameters are 
 passed to inner subroutines (in order to avoid possible subscripts in
 slewflat array).   
Version 1.10.5 23/10/2001   additional check and integer data conversion
 to CheckArrayBounds in order to avoid a failure at Cosine3 machine 
Version 1.10.4 22/10/2001   a clarifying massage added to CheckArrayBounds subroutine
Version 1.10.3 19/10/2001   more robust call to CheckArrayBounds subroutine	
Version 1.10.2 18/10/2001   data set in /test directory has been updated in order
	                    to rectify task test
Version 1.10.1 08/10/2001   DEPEND file modified to rectify SOC build program.
Version 1.10  08/05/2001    Corrections in slewFlat fastImgP arrays calculations
Version 1.9   01/11/2000    /src/Makefile ammended- cal added to fix .
Version 1.8   05/10/2000    Missing layout file rectified.
Version 1.7   02/10/2000    No changes
