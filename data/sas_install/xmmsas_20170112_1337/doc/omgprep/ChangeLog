ChangeLog for omgprep
===================

Version 1.10 - 2016-09-07 (AI) 
-------------
	+ (src/omgprep_mod.f90) Initialization to null of all pointers 
	that are passed to C++ (Dope vectors). If we do not initizialize 
	the pointers, we get seg fault at run-time with gcc-6.2.	

Version 1.9.1 - 2016-01-12 (AI) 
-------------
	+ (src/utility_mod.f90)  Memory allocation error using NAG fortran 
	6.2 fixed.
	
Version 1.9 - 2009-04-06 (VNY) (+src/background_mod.f90) make it possible
	to deal with two types of data in the quality map: int8 or int16
	in order to adjust this task to the recent changes in omdetect.
Version 1.8 - 2008-09-26 (VNY) (+src/background_mod.f90) Fixing a small
	bug, which might cause a crash with the array limits subscript
	message (for imageMask2 array).
Version 1.7 - 2008-09-17 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90, +src/background_mod.f90)
	Introducing two new (not mandatory) parameters: removescatteredlight
	and backgroundset in order to add the capability of removing the
	scattered light features from the grisn rotated image.
Version 1.6 - 2007-01-25 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) A bug was fixed
	(which was probably introduces in version 1.1.3) causing a shift
	of the wavelength scale by about 50 Angstroems (SPR-3645)
Version 1.5 - 2006-11-09 (VNY) (+src/omgpreo_mod.f90) A lot of small
	changes are introduced to get more accurate grism source
	voordinates (SSC-SPR-3633)
Version 1.4 - 2006-08-02 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) When computing
        the spectra extractability factor the binning of the image was
	mistakenly applied to the cooordinates of the reference (target)
	source. This was causing a  possibly wrong extractability factor 
	for the low-resolution mode and, as a result, skipping the 
	exposure from further processing - fixing the SSC-SPR-3623.
Version 1.3 - 2006-07-11 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) The values given
	in the MODES table of the output file are corrected (to correspond
	to the values given by DETSEC keyword in the header of the 
	main table (SSC-SPR-3622)
Version 1.2 - 2006-06-30 (VNY) VERSION
	The same as the version 1.1.3
Version 1.1.3 - 2006-06-26 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) A new keyword is
        introduced to indicate the extractability of the spectrum 
	from OSW (SSC-SPR-3616); also a correction 
	of the RA and DEC values for the reference pixel in the 
	header of the output file is made (previously the reference 
	pixel corresponded to the centre of the image, which is not
	the case for the grism filter)
Version 1.1.2 - 2006-06-09 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) A small bug
	causing a subscription error message is fixed ((SSC-SPR-3607)
Version 1.1.1 - 2006-06-09 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90)
        Introducing a flag indicating (by returning a zero or non-zero value) 
	that the spectrum is extractable from the grism-image or not (SSC-SPR-3606).
Version 1.1 - 2005-09-28 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) : fixed a problem
	of propagation of keywords in the header of the output file
	(SSC-SPR-3525)
Version 1.0.4 - 2005-06-01 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90): the moire
	pattern, which appeared due to undistortion of the image 
	is removed (fixing SSC-SPR-3462)
Version 1.0.3 - 2004-07-26 (VNY) (+src/omgprep_mod.f90) 
	The WSC keywords are removed from the output
	file, because they were causing the appearence of a
	very odd coordinate grid when working with ds9 and fv
	tools (SSC-SPR-3363)
Version 1.0.2 - 2004-07-01 (VNY) The number of extra pixels added 
	at the edges of the image is divided by the binning factor
	(SSC-SPR-3346)
Version 1.0.1 - 2004-05-13 (VNY) The output image enlarged in order 
	not to miss pixels at the edge due to the distortion
	correction (SSC-SPR-3318)
Version 1.0 - 2003-12-04 (VNY) Version number passed to 1.0
Version 0.5 - 2003-11-25 (VNY) +(src/omgprep_mod.f90) a bug in 
	the distortion correction procedure is fixed
Version 0.4 - 2003-11-21 (VNY) DEPEND file ammended to the new
	version (3.0) of ssclib
Version 0.3 - 2003-11-11 (VNY) +src/omgprep_mod.f90 the code tiden
	      +test/testoutput_mod.f90 the dataset read option relaxed
Version 0.2 - 2003-11-07 (VNY) +src/omgprep_mod.f90, +config/omgprep.par:
              the parameter name "ppsoswset" replaced with "outset" 
Version 0.1 - 2003-10-24 (VNY) +src/omgprep_mod.f90 
	New task created, SAS-SCR-116
