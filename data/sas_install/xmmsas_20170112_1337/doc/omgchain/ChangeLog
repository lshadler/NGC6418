ChangeLog for omgchain
===============================

Version 1.11.1 - 2014-09-30 (RDS) 
--------------
        +(src/omgchain.pl) Uses taskmain to handle command line options
Version 1.11 - 2014-04-02 (EC)
	- Moved test data (*0125910501*) to testprods/omgchain_data
	- Removed other unused binary data
Version 1.10 - 2010-07-20 (VNY) Protected against a bug in the 
	pgplot program which is used in the task. This bug was
	resulting in file name truncation and disappearance of
	the files from the output directory (SSC-SPR-6622)
Version 1.9 - 2008-09-17 (VNY) New parameter (removescatteredlight) 
	is introduced to enable removing scattered light features
	by the task omgprep
Version 1.8 - 2008-05-01 (VNY) Modified the call to omgrism plot
	in order to produce the PostScript file with spectra extraction
	regions plotted over the grism rotated image
Version 1.7 - 2007-11-02 (VNY) +(config/omgchain.par) Added a parameter
	(addedregionfile) to enable the output of a new region file for
	newly detected point sources (extra sources missing in the 
	region file from omdetect)
Version 1.6 - 2007-05-22 (VNY) +(config/omgchain.par) The default parameter
	for the width of the spectrum extraction region was set to 8 pixels
	because this is what actually was used in the task omgrism due to a
	small bug. The bug was fixed in Omgrism-1.17 (accompanying the 
	SSC-SPR-3660) so that omgchain is also adjusted to keep the spectrum
	extraction region the same as before.  
Version 1.5 - 2007-01-31 (VNY) 	The file names are modified such that 
	they include the symbol with the observation mode idenifies 
	(S, U or X). Previosly this symbol was fixed (S) since it was 
	thought that the observations are always sheduled (fixing SSC-SPR-3646)
Version 1.4 - 2006-11-09 (VNY) The parameters of the omatt task 
	are modified to adjust to the changest in the OM GRISM tasks
	improving the accuracy of the grism sources RA and DECs. 
	Grism sky image is generated to visualise the sky positions
	of the sources.
Version 1.3 - 2006-06-09 (VNY) Using the possibility of analysing the 
	image size and the extractability of spectra, which is provided
	by omgprep-1.1.1 (SSC-SPR-3606)
Version 1.2 - 2006-05-30 (VNY) Introducing a new task into the chain:
	omatt, which will be able to produce the sky image and compute
	the right ascentiona and declinations of the zero-orders
	(SSC-SPR-3606). The version 2.41 of omatt is requires, as
	well as the calibration file OM_ASTROMET_0012.CCF with the
	corresponding untility in caloalutils-1.100.
Version 1.1 - 2005-09-07 (VNY) Documentation corrected (SSC-SPR-3508),
	the dependencies file is made consistent with the lates 
	version of omgrism.
Version 1.0.12 - 2005-06-09 (VNY) +(test/testomgchain) Test harness is 
	optimised to fit in the time slot for tests
Version 1.0.11 - 2005-05-23 (CB) Removed some commented-out line in perl script.
Version 1.0.10 - 2005-05-23 (CB) Ammended DEPEND file to fix build failure.	
Version 1.0.9 - 2004-09-08 (VNY) +(src/omgchain.pl) The spectra list file 
	is generated for both values of the parameter extractfieldspectra.
	That is, when extracting even a single (target) spectrum the 
	the SPECLI-file will contain only one line. But having always 
	the same set of the output files would simplify understanding 
	the results by the user (SSC-SPR-3382).
Version 1.0.8 - 2004-07-27 (VNY) +(src/omgchain.pl) Adjusted to use the
	new parameters for the task omgrism (SSC-SPR=3365)
Version 1.0.7 - 2004-07-15 (VNY) +(config/omgchain.par) Default options
	for the spectra extraction region are changed from 3 to 6 pixels
	(SSC-SPR-3355)
Version 1.0.6 - 2004-06-29 (VNY) +(src/omgchain.pl) Correction in the 
	subroutine GetODFDirectory in order to protect the task from 
	failing during its test on Mac-machines	
Version 1.0.5 - 2004-05-27 (VNY) +(test/testomgchain) Picking up
	the SAS_ODF variable is modified to protect from the 
	test failure on Mac-machines
Version 1.0.4 - 2004-05-20 (VNY) Engineering-2 sub-window
	files are sorted at the input according to their names in order to
	ensure combining of these sub-windows into a single 
	full-frame image (SSC-SPR-3324)
Version 1.0.3 - 2004-02-24 (VNY) the use DAL statement is removed
	since it is not necessary anymore
Version 1.0.2 - 2004-02-03 (VNY) two optional parameters to be used 
	by omgrismplot are included (plotflux and bkgdyscale)
Version 1.0.1 - 2004-02-01 (VNY) Protected against crushing when the 
	verbosity level is higher than seven. The input parameter
	extractionmode is activated.
Version 1.0 - 2003-12-04 (VNY) extraction of undetected spectra included
Version 0.6 - 2003-12-02 (VNY) the parameters spectrumlength and 
	      src2spectrum are removed as misleading
Version 0.5 - 2003-11-18 (VNY) DEPEND file ammended to the new version
	of ssclib (3.0) 
Version 0.4 - 2003-11-10 (VNY) protected from crashing if no PS-files
	      were found
Version 0.3 - 2003-10-31 (VNY) the parameters for spectra extraction
	      region are passed to omgrism
Version 0.2 - 2003-10-29 (VNY) references to the input and output
              directories are corrected
	 
Version 0.1 - 2003-10-27 (VNY) An additional parameter is introduced for 
	      the task OMGPREP (in order to smooth the image); 2003-03-05 
	      (VNY) Created using omfchain.pl and testompcomp.pl codes OMDETECT-4.1 
	      instead of V3.6; 2002-09-27 (VNY) Testompcomp.pl code written
