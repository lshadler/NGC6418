Version 2.3 - 2011-06-14 (MAS/LUX)
----------------------
- DEPENDency on ssclib upgraded to 4.25.
- cube2im:
  + Fixed a bug, where it used to fail when the last chip is blank, by fixing cubeToDet() in eimchip2sky_aux .

  + It now uses ssclib/epic_aux .
  + Added new subroutines of rawImageToDet() and cubeToDet().
  + Created its test harness.
- cube2im:
  + Now requires cube_aux.f90 and eimchip2sky_aux.f90 to compile and uses the modules in ssclib of array_utils, dal_aux, epic_aux and save_image.
  + Introduced new command-line parameters of outputraw, outputdet and outdetset.
  + Now can output DETX/DETY image instead of or in addition to the RAW chip images, if specified so.

  + Introduced new command-line parameters of withccdnr, ccdnr, withnodenr, nodenr.
  + Created its test harness.

Version 2.1.1 - 2009-03-04 (MAS/LUX)
----------------------
- Fixed a serious bug in writeCubeDataLogical_temp() in cube_aux.f90 (for the library chipcube).
	
Version 2.1 - 2009-02-02 (IMS/JBO)
----------------------
- Originally developed by IMS/JBO on 2006-10-19.
- Changed ssclib version in DEPEND to 4.0.
- Removed modules for which functionality is now found within ssclib.
- Deleted src/old_code.
- Added task im2cube.
- Overloaded cube_aux:writeCubeData to double and ints 32, 16 and 8.

Version 2.0.1 - 2006-05-07 (IMS/JBO)
----------------------
- Filled in a few error messages and slightly updated the documentation.
- Added an inadvertently omitted parameter --withindices to eimchip2sky.
- Renamed --withcubeindices and --cubeindices of ecubechip2sky to --withindices and --indices respectively.

Version 2.0 - 2005-11-07 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Upgraded to comply with interface changes in attcalc-1.2.
- DEPENDency on attcalc2 changed to 1.2.
- DEPENDency on ssclib changed to 3.27.
- Parameter --withbinnedattset replaced by --attstyle to come into line with interfaces for ebkgmap and lccorr tasks.
- Many more options for weighting the attitude samples are now provided.
- Task eimchip2sky split into two: eimchip2sky and ecubechip2sky. These are the same, except the 1st accepts a list of chip images as input, whereas the second accepts a (list of) cube(s) as input. The previous eimchip2sky accepted either, but with the additional capability, the parameter interface was getting a bit snarled up. The split simplifies things.

Version 1.10 - 2005-11-02 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Former logical(bool) overloading of subroutine cube_aux.f90:writeCubeData now requires a plain logical cube argument; it also now writes the key table.
- Changed some prints to 'call message' in chip2im and eimchip2sky_aux.
- Added some error codes.
- Now it's possible to have --withbinnedattset=no and --withgtisets=no. Task wouldn't allow this before.

Version 1.9 - 2005-04-05 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Changed DEPEND on attcalc2 to 1.0 to fix build problem.

Version 1.8 - 2004-11-08 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Package seems to need 'selector' in the USEDLIBS line to compile under linux.

Version 1.7 - 2004-09-06 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- An allocatable array was allocated within a loop but not deallocated. This is now fixed.

Version 1.6 - 2004-09-06 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Rearranged the parameters a little so as to allow the task to write to several output images (of identical wcs and dimensions). This has entailed: changing --chipcubeset to --chipcubesets and --outset to --outsets; deleting --outstyle (the task now is restricted to creating new images rather than adding to existing ones); and adding --withcubeindices, --cubeindices and --indices.
- Introduced new parameters --withnodes and --nodes.
- --multiplybytime deleted and --withnormalize and --normstyle substituted.
- --withccds replaced by --ccdstyle.
- --withgtis changed to --ignorecubegtis.
- Moved gtiVecType (was intervalVecType) from cube_aux to ssclib/intervals_aux.
- attcalc2 dependency increased to 0.3; ssclib dependency increased to 3.16.
- String parameter --regridstyle replaced by boolean --conserveflux.

Version 1.5 - 2004-08-17 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Added approximate rebinning algorithm (which hopefully will be faster). A new parameter --usefast has been added to access this algorithm.
- writeCubeData now takes a vector, of new type keyInfoType, which it writes to a binary table extension of the output. The rows of this link each image plane with a ccd/node number and also the name of the GTI extension.
- New routine readCubeData added to cube_aux.

Version 1.4 - 2004-08-10 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Added taskmain to DEPEND.

Version 1.3 - 2004-06-28 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Added patch to deal with non-zero roll angle until SOC SPR 2523 is implemented.
- In module cube_aux.f90, routine writeCubeData now overloaded to accept both real(single) and logical(bool) cube arguments.
- Now uses library binnedatt in (probably temporary) package attcalc2. attcalc2 added to DEPEND.
- Test harness now fails if test data not found.

Version 1.2 - 2004-05-03 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Attitude and timestamp info is now sought in the template image rather than the cube dataset.
- Added parameter --withgtis, active when --instyle='cube'.

Version 1.1 - 2004-05-03 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- 'use polygon' changed to 'use regridders' and thus now depends on ssclib-3.10.
- Tasks eimpolar2sky and eimdet2polar added.

Version 1.0 - 2004-04-30 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Probably about time to go to version 1.0. The name has been changed from echip2sky (SCR 2517).
- Updated the ssclib interfaces to 3.9 standard.
- Rearranged code so as to provide access to the central algorithm by other tasks.

Version 0.4 - 2004-04-05 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Now uses test data in package testprods.

Version 0.3 - 2004-03-25 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Copy of patches to devtrack.

Version 0.2.2 - 2003-12-17 (IMS SSC/LUX)
----------------------------
- Added 'selector' to the src/Makefile:USEDLIBS line. Without this the task wouldn't compile statically. Fixes SPR 3177.

Version 0.2.1 - 2003-12-12 (IMS SSC/LUX)
----------------------------
- Added some documentation.

Version 0.2 - 2003-12-11 (IMS SSC/LUX)
----------------------------
- Changed to reflect the movement of andIntervals from ssclib/dss_aux to ssclib/intervals_aux.

Version 0.1 - 2003-12-10 (IMS SSC/LUX)
----------------------------
- First draft.
