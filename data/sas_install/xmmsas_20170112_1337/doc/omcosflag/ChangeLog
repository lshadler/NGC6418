ChangeLog for omcosflag
=======================

Version 1.33 - 2014-04-02 (EC)
	- Remove unused binaries from test/
	- Improve testomcosflag by removing outputs
Version 1.32 - 2013-07-10 (VNY)
	+(src/omcosflag_mod.f90) further protection  against 
	the possibility of geting a wrong binning factor; 
	fixed a mistake in the check of the windowDX size as 
	its value is always unbinned and cannot be used for 
	checking the binning factor. The task version 1.32 
	is equivelent to 1.29.3.
Version 1.31 - 2013-06-39 (VNY)
	+(src/omcosflag_mod.f90) Protected against the possibility of 
	calculating a wrong binning factor for some OM images, which
	was leading to the output quality map having wrong sizes
	(continuation of solving the problem reported in SSC-SPR-7109);
	the task version 1.31 is equivalent to 1.29.2
Version 1.30 - 2013-05-21 (VNY)
	+(src/omcosflag_mod.f90)
	Fixed a bug leading to a subscript error message for the quality array
	of some full-frame high-resolution images
	(SSC-SPR-7109)
