Behaviours and command-line arguments.

<P>
This task accepts either an event or image file as an input
(controlled by <TT>inputstyle</TT>), and outputs either the sky coordinate
image or 3-dimensional chipcube (controlled by <TT>outputstyle</TT>).

<P>
In short, we recommend to specify an event file as an input,
and the sky coordinate image as an output, of which the reasons are
described below.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>if the input is an event file and the output is the chipcube, the process runs as follows:
<BR>
The task calculates the normalised count-per-frame-per-pixel (=rate) map
  for each chip, taking account of the energy (PI) of each event.
  Then the pixels, where the rate exceeds the given threshold, are masked
  and it is output. <A NAME="epileupmask:description:item1"></A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>if the input is an event file and the output is the sky-coordinate image, the process runs as follows:
<BR>
The core of the routine is exactly the same as the above case.  However,
  the coordinate conversion into sky-coordinates is not a trivial job,
  as the pile-up phenomenon is basically processed on the chip(raw)
  coordinates.  Hence a user is allowed to specify the binned-attitude file.
  If this (<TT>binnedattset</TT>) is set, the task splits the event files into 
  the given time bins (described in the file <TT>binnedattset</TT>),
  performs the above-described calculation (of the normalised rate map)
  for each of these time bins, converts each normalised rate map and mask map
  into the sky coordinates<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot413"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../icons/footnote.png"></SUP></A>.  Finally
  the task calculates the logical sum of the mask file.  In other words,
  all the pixels that experience the rate above the threshold in one of
  the time bins are masked.  Note that frames with too short duration
  are not used in this calculation of rate and mask images (Controlled by
  <TT>avcnttoprocess</TT>) in this case.  If a user specifies so
  (controlled by <TT>attstyle</TT>), the entire observation is used as
  one set -- in that case, the spatial fluctuation of the spacecraft
  is not taken into account (the median attitude value is simply used for
  the coordinate conversion).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>if the input is an image file and the output is the chipcube,
<BR>
the process is similar to the case&nbsp;<A HREF="#epileupmask:description:item1">1</A>.
  However the energy of each event is unknown.  Therefore the image
  is assumed to have a single energy, which is the mean
  energy of those specified by the user (Controlled by
  <TT>evlo</TT> and <TT>evhi</TT>).  As for the attitude of the spacecraft,
  which is used in converting the sky coordinates to the chip ones,
  the median attitude value is simply used.

<P>
A potential problem is when the image bin size is larger than 
  the chip-coordinate one, the output mask on the chip-coordinates
  will be sparse, because only the central value of the image coordinates
  are taken into account in the current algorithm.
  For example, suppose the former is twice as larger than
  the latter, and all the image pixels exceed the piled-up threshold,
  then only one in every 4 pixels in the chipcube is flagged as piled-up.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>if the input is an image file and the output is the sky-coordinate image, too,
<BR>
the task does the same thing as the above case, although the output
  file is in the same coordinates.  However, the spacecraft attitude
  information is still needed to get the (number of) frame information
  for each pixel.  The median attitude value is used for that purpose.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Note the algorithm is identical to that in <A NAME="466"></A><A NAME="tex2html3"
