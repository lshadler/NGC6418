ChangeLog for omgrism
===============================
Version 1.25.1 - 2012-03-28 (EO) 
--------------
	+ src/Makefile: Added EXTERNALS = pgplot to get rid of missing pgplot.
Version 1.25 - 2011-03-24 (VNY) +(config/omgrism.info) Adding the
	group OM to correct the location of the task web page.
Version 1.24 - 2008-11-06 (VNY)	 +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) A bug 
	is fixed, which was causing a crash when processing 
	images with crowded fields (the parameter for the smoothing 
	window size was reduced to zero for a field with more than 550 sources)
Version 1.23 - 2008-10-01 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) Added some 
	useful log messages
Version 1.22 - 2007-11-07 (VNY) The same as 1.21, the version number 
	was increased to align it with the SAS patch release
Version 1.21 - 2007-11-07 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) Restoring the 
	omgsource flag when extracting the target spectrum: in the 
	case when omgrism is called from the interactive tool omgsource
	the target spectrum shouldn't be extracted (fixing the SSC-SPR-3702)
Version 1.20 - 2007-11-07 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90, config/omgrism.par)
	Added a parameter enabling the output of an additional region
	file that contains newly detected point-like sources (zero-order
	features)
Version 1.19 - 2007-10-20 (VNY) +(src/omgextraction_mod.f90) Fixed a
	bug that could result in a crash of the task when processing 
	crowded fields (SSC-SPR-3700)
Version 1.18.1 - 2007-07-08 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) Fixing a bug
	that results in a wrongly calculated available spectrum length
	of the target (SSC-SPR-3694)
Version 1.18 - 2007-05-22 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) A small bug fixed	
Version 1.17 - 2007-05-21 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90, omgextraction_mod.f90)
	Improving distinguishability of close spectra (fixing SSC-SPR-3660)
Version 1.16 - 2007-04-15 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) More improvement 
	in the field spectra extraction (SPR-3644)
Version 1.15 - 2007-04-02 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) Improved the field
	spectra extraction by allowing slightly fainter spectra 
	to be extracted (SSC-SPR-3644)
Version 1.14 - 2007-03-29 (VNY) +(src/omgextraction_mod.f90) The code is 
	cleaned up, the possible division by zero operation is eliminated
        (fixing SSC-SPR-3658)	
Version 1.13 - 2007-03-27 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) A bug is fixed

	(fixed SSC-SPR-3657)
Version 1.12 - 2007-03-12 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) The quality flag
	type in the input source list table is changed: now it can be 
	either int*8 or int*16 (fixing SSC-SPR-3653). A warning message
	is isssued when the number of input sources exceeds 1000. Such
	a field cannot be processed yet (SSC-SPR-3643). Also the target
	detection is improved: in the cases of a bright target overlapped 
	with a first order-features such a target was sometimes not detected.
	Now it is working better.
Version 1.11 - 2006-11-09 (VNY) +(src/omgrism_mod.f90) Adjusted to the 
	changes in other tasks related to more accurate computation
	of grism source sky positions (SSC-SPR-3633)
Version 1.10 - 2006-07-03 (VNY) +(scr/omgrism_mod.f90) A slightly more 
	complicated analysis of the target position and brightness 
	is introduces in order to prevent missclassification of obvious 
	bright targets (they sometimes are classified as "default 
	extraction" although being correctly extracted) - SSC-SPR-3617 	
Version 1.9 - 2006-02-27 (VNY) +(scr/omgrism_mod.f90, omgextraction_mod.f90)

	extraction the spectrum due to the smallness of the 
	window (SSC-SPR-3526)
Version 1.4 - 2005-09-26 (VNY) (+src/findsourcelist_mod.f90, 
	omgexcratcion_mod.f90, omgrism_mod.f90) Fixing a small bug,
	which could lead to a crash when working with some non-standard
	data sets (SSC-SPR-3522)
Version 1.3 - 2005-09-12 (VNY) (+src/findsourcelist_mod.f90) reducing the 
	used stack memory, since in some systems this resource is limited>
	This change is additional to fixing SSC-SPR-3515.
Version 1.2 - 2005-09-07 (VNY) (+src/omgrism_mod.f90, omgextraction_mod.f90)
	The computation of the coordinates of the zero-order spectrum
	is made the same for all the possible cases (SPR-3515)
Version 1.1.30 - 2005-07-14 (VNY) (+src/omgextraction_mod.f90) 
	A bug in the Marquardt optimisation code is fixed. This was 
	affecting the optimal extraction mode (SSC-SPR-3434). The main
	(default) extraction mode remaines unchanged.
Version 1.1.29 - 2005-06-10 (VNY) (+src/findsourceslist_mod.f90,
	omgrism_mod.f90) Additional check is introduced in order to ensure 
	that the bright zero-order features have right coordinates 
	(they could be erroneous because of numerous bright spots
	due to coincidence losses and modulo-8 noise). Fixed SSC-SPR-3479
Version 1.1.28 - 2005-06-10 (VNY) (+src/findsourceslist_mod.f90)

	omgextraction_mod.f90, marq_mod.f90)
 	Additional checks are introduced to ensure the correct extraction
	of the target spectra in the cases when its zero-order image is 
	badly affected by the modulo-8 noise (SSC-SPR-3465). The common
	block is deleted from marq_mod.f90 (this was not used but caused
	a build failure on the Mac).
Version 1.1.24 - 2005-05-23 (CB1) +(src/omgextraction_mod.f90
	Ammended routine to fix build problem.	
Version 1.1.23 - 2005-02-22 (VNY) +(src/omgextraction_mod.f90): 
	the negative counts that could appear when subtracting the 
	background from a faint spectrum are taken into account. 
	Omitting the negative counts might result in a slight overestimation
	of the spectrum (SSC-SPR-3444)
Version 1.1.22 - 2005-01-27 (VNY) +(src/omgextraction_mod.f90): 
	correction of an additional small (logical) bug related

	patch improving the solution of SSC-SPR-3407 is added

	+src/omgextraction_mod.f90) Logical sequence in determination
	of the target is improved - to eliminate the possibility of
	labelling the default extraction region as target
	(SSC-SPR-3407)

	bug is fixed related to SSC-SPR-3398
Version 1.1.16 - 2004-10-05 (VNY) (+src/omgrism_mod.f90) A small bug
	is fixed, which was causing imroper labelling of the target
	spectrum (SSC-SPR-3398)
Version 1.1.15 - 2004-10-01 (VNY) (+src/omgrism_mod.f90, 
	+src/omgextraction_mod.f90) The procedure of decontamination
	of the output spectrum, in the case when it is overlapped with
	zero-order features, is removed (SSC-SPR-3396).
	It is supposed that this procedure is more appropriate
	in the task omgrismplot.

	+src/omgextraction_mod.f90) Interpolation of the 
	wavelengths and fluxes at the end of the flux 
	calibration array is improved in order to avoid

        omgextraction_mod.f90) The spectrum extraction mode
	keyword is passed to the omgrismplot task through the
	header keyword EXTRMODE. The keyword TIMEDEL replaced
	with DLAMBDA (SSC-SPR-3319). Some other small changes 
	are made in order to imrove task's performance.	
Version 1.1.8 - 2004-03-03 (VNY) (+src/omgrism_mod.f90) Rejecttion
	criterium for spurious sources is improved
Version 1.1.7 - 2004-02-23 (VNY)  (+src/omgrism_mod.f90) A small bug

	working always in the regime designed for omgsource
	(SSC-SPR-3257)
Version 1.1.6 - 2004-02-19 (VNY) (+src/omgrism_mod.f90) Protected from 
	crushing when called by omgsource
Version 1.1.5 - 2004-02-12 (VNY) (+src/omgrism_mod.f90) Selection
