combines the calibration bad pixel data from the CCF
 with any hot pixels found by analyzing the raw telemetry for one CCD
 from an RGS exposure.  The result is stored in the <A NAME="451"></A><TT>BADPIXn</TT>
 extension tables of the input dataset, or in a separate dataset if
 requested (<TT>withbadpixset</TT>=yes).  When the same bad pixel is
 identified by both the CCF and the telemetry analysis, the output bad
 pixel table mentions only the CCF version.  CCF bad pixels that lie
 outside the telemetry window of the exposure are not included.  The
 columns of the <A NAME="454"></A><TT>BADPIXn</TT> tables describe these properties:
 location, type and source.  Location is specified in chip-oriented
 coordinates, and describes a column segment of similar bad pixels in
 terms of its minimum y-axis coordinate and upward extent.  The type
 codes are described in the CAL documentation.  The source codes are
 as follows:

<P>

<OL>
<LI><P>
A bad pixel obtained from the CCF, and listed there as having been
  uplinked to the on-board data preprocessor (DPP).  Such pixels
  should never appear in the telemetry, and should therefore never be
  identified by the telemetry analysis.  There is no option to exclude
  these from the output bad pixel tables; to do so would corrupt the
  exposure map.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><P>
A bad pixel obtained from the CCF, but not listed as having been
  uplinked to the DPP. If marked as hot ("H") in the CCF, these are regarded 
  as advisory, and may be
  excluded from the output bad pixel tables (<TT>withadvisory</TT>=no). The
  default is to include them.One would hope that any of these listed as hot would also be
  identified by the telemetry analysis.
<BR>
In addition defective columns, showing often a larger CTI and therefore 
  appearing as "cooler" than they should be, can be included in the list of bad
  pixels (<TT>keepcool</TT>=yes) as well. They are listed in the corresponding 
  CCF (RGS[1][2]_COOLPIX_xxxx) as "D". 
  The default (so far) is not to treat them as bad columns. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><P>
A bad pixel identified by analysis of the telemetry.  The current
  algorithm only attempts to find isolated hot pixels and columns.
  This process is optional and may be disabled
  (<TT>withfoundhot</TT>=no).

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Four parameters control the hot pixel finding algorithm, which is an
 implementation of John Peterson's memo, RGS-COL-CAL-00015.  First the
 pixels are analyzed individually for excessive activity and then the
 same is done for whole columns.  <TT>pixnoiselimit</TT> and
 <TT>colnoiselimit</TT> respectively are the minimum uncalibrated
 energies for considering single-pixel events in the first and second
 phases.  <TT>pixsharpness</TT> and <TT>colsharpness</TT> respectively
 control the degree of excessive activity required to flag a pixel or
 column as hot.  Refer to section
 <A HREF="node8.html#rgsbadpix:description:algorithm">8</A> for the precise meaning of the
 sharpness parameters.  Frames marked with <A NAME="463"></A><TT>IN_BAD_FRAME</TT> in
 the <A NAME="465"></A><TT>FLAG</TT> column of the <A NAME="467"></A><TT>EXPOSURE</TT> table are considered
 bad and their pixels are discarded.

<P>
In High Time Resolution (HTR) mode the entire cross-dispersion
 dimension is collapsed into one row; hence it is not possible to
 consider individual bad pixels.  If hot pixel finding is enabled the
 hot column finder works just the same way as in Spectroscopy mode but
 the initial search for individual hot pixels is skipped.  Throughout
 this document a <IMG
