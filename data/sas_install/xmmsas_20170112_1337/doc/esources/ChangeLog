- The task now (optionally) sets the SPECTRA and TSERIES flag columns of the input source list to indicate those sources chosen for source-specific products. This has necessitated a new parameter --setflags.

----------------------------
- Fixed a bug which was writing backward hex numbers plus nonsense to the file.
- Added new parameter --instweights.
- Task now writes src counts for each instrument and the equivalent epic counts.
- Task now writes RA_CORR and DEC_CORR columns.
- Task was trying to read source list columns PN_SCTS etc whereas the real names are PN_CTS etc. This now fixed.
- Task was trying to read TSTART, TSTOP keywords from event list dataset header rather than (the correct) EVENTS table header. This now fixed.
- Task now checks for null values in *_ONTIME columns as well as *_CTS columns.
- Directory structure created by pkgmaker.
