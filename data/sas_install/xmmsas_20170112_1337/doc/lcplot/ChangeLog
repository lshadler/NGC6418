ChangeLog for lcplot
===============================

Version 1.21 - 2016-07-15 (AI)
-------------------------------
	+ (src/lcplot_mod.f90) "label" variable renamed (this word is 
	not allowed in gfortran).

Version 1.20.1 - 2013-03-05 (NW)
        -------------------------------

	A check for NaN values is now included and a warning is called if  
	all of the data points have values=NaN. The PSF FRAC. INCLUDED 
	length has also been reduced to make the output plot clearer. The 
	documentation has been updated to include the new warning.
	

Version 1.20 - 2012-03-07 (NW)
        -------------------------------

	The lengths of certain characters have been reduced to avoid
	overwriting observation information on the output plot, in
	response to SPR 6636.
 

Version 1.19.1 - 2007-06-07 (NW)
        -------------------------------

	Previously when the non background subtracted curve was supplied 
	the title of the plot was 'background subtracted'.  It has now 
	been changed to 'Non background subtracted'.



Version 1.19 - 2005-09-06 (NW)
        -------------------------------

	Added a new parameter 'tests' which allows the user to decide if 
	they want to carry out both probability of constancy tests or 
	just the chi-squared test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  The 
	documentation has also been updated.


Version 1.18.1 - 2005-01-28 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Changes made to identifying NULLS and some arithmetic changes
	made to stop lcplot crashing with NULL and negative values.

	
Version 1.18 - 2004-19-14 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Small changes introduced to allow lcplot to read the source RA and
	DEC from the headers correctly and thus plot the correct
	information on the the output plot (SPR-3282).

	
Version 1.17.1 - 2004-05-14 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Small change introduced to stop lcplot crashing with some lccorr
	files (SPR-3312) and changes to the presentation of the header
	information of the output plot (SPR-3289).

	
Version 1.17 - 2002-07-25 (NW)
        -------------------------------
 
        Updated the DEPEND file. It now includes a dependence on sas.
                                    
                                            
Version 1.16.1 - 2002-06-04 (NW)
----------------------

        Made changes to the plot, by increasing the size and colour of the
 	text to make it more readable and changing the plot layout in
 	general.

	
Version 1.16 - 2002-06-03 (NW)
----------------------

        Made the updates necessary for the new version of param
	

Version 1.15 - 17-04-02
----------------------- 

	A loop included that removes bins with a low exposure and
	therefore large errors, from the plot as requested by JO.
	Documentation also updated.

Version 1.14.1 - 09-01-02
----------------------- 
	
        Data now referenced to TSTART and not to TIMEZERO, according to
	the OGIP recommendation.  Documentation also changed to
	incorporate this change.

	
Version 1.14 - 7-12-01
	-----------------------
	
        Version number increment as requested for the new public release
	cycle.

	
Version 1.13.9 - 4-12-01
----------------------- 
	
        Even more information has been added to the output plot in
	response to SPR 2659: which OSW a light curve has come from, the
	filename of the plotted file and the plotted bin size.


Version 1.13.8 - 20-11-01
----------------------- 
	
        New information has been added to the output plot: exposure ID,
	source number, source position, source and background
	re-extraction region areas, background light curve subtraction,
	fraction of the PSF included in the source lightcurve, and is a
	correction applied for this.  The version of lcplot is also
	included in the bottom left hand corner.  The documentation has
	consequently been updated.

	
Version 1.13.7 - 07-11-01
----------------------- 
	
        A new parameter has been introduced (bkgdyscale) which by default
	is set to `no', but can be set to `yes' so that the y-scale of the
	background counts is the same as the source counts, in response to
	SPR-2616.
	
	
Version 1.13.6 - 22-10-01
----------------------- 
	
	The test has been radically changed so that it doesn't test the
	.ps file, as these are never standard.	
	

Version 1.13.5 - 19-10-01
----------------------- 
	
        The test has been changed so that if it does fail, the output 
	is not long and a small revision has been made to the errors, as they         were not accurate.

	
Version 1.13.4 - 7-09-01
----------------------- 

	The times, aswell as the dates, are now printed in the title of
	the output of lcplot and the format of TIMEZERO has been changed
	so that more decimal places are shown, in response to SPR 2509.

        
Version 1.13.3 - 22-05-01
----------------------- 

        The documentation has been updated to include examples of how to
	use lcplot.  The program only calls a warning, rather than an
	error for if the values of the count rates and their associated
	errors are <0.0, so that it can be used after background
	subtraction of images with few counts.
        
	
Version 1.13.2 - 27-04-01
----------------------- 
	The dimensions of the array Label were not consistent throughout
 	the task.  This has been rectified.  The test harness has been
 	changed to be variable for Linux or Unix, because the environment
 	variables are different.  In this way, the test can be passed on
 	Linux or Unix.

	

Version 1.13.1 - 08-02-01
-----------------------  
        The environment variables for `pgplot' were different to those 
	at the `static build' and hence the test was not passed, as the 
	output files were different to the comparison files.  The 
	environment variables for `pgplot' are now changed, so the 
	output files of the `static build' should pass the test.

	
Version 1.13 - 19-12-00
-----------------------  
        The lcplot test no longer uses gs, as requested by the SPR 2153. 


Version 1.12.1 - 9-11-00
-----------------------  
        lcplot now accepts single time series FITS files or several
        time series FITS files produced by `elcbuild' for EPIC
        and `omlcbuild' for the OM.  Documentation also updated.

	
Version 1.12 - 31-10-00
-----------------------  
        Updated lcplot GROUPS description and the lcplot documentation

Version 1.11 - 03-10-00
-----------------------  
        Updrade the version number as required for the SAS V5

Version 1.10.1 26-09-00
-----------------------
	Update the .info file (remove the non existing interactive GROUP) 

Version 1.10 22-05-00
--------------------
	Add lcplot.info in the config directory

Version 1.9 18-04-00
--------------------

	The following SPR has been corrected:

	 SSC-SPR-1642 lcplot (version 1.8): documentation macros

	
Version 1.8 07-03-00
--------------------

	The following SPRs have been corrected:

 	SSC-SPR-1529 lcplot (version 1.7): The precise description of chi2
 	and KS tests should be given into description.
        
   	SSC-SPR-1530 lcplot (version 1.7): When testing the input file
 	format check, the error message is not well adapted

   	SSC-SPR-1531 lcplot (version 1.7): when output file already
 	exists, lcplot always overwrite it

   	SSC-SPR-1532 lcplot (version 1.7): the variance is computed by
 	dividing by n : the number of elements as it should be n-1

	
Version 1.7 09-02-00
--------------------

Version 1.6 26-11-99
--------------------

Version 1.4 29-07-99
--------------------

- Fixes SSC-SPR-1124: lcplot : Task parameters do not conform to convention
- SSC-SPR-1125 was in fact out of the scope; the bug was elsewhere.
