<LI>If the chain runs to completion, a number of important output files will
appear. The chain product filenames have the extension `.FIT'. The names of the
files start with `P' for the products and with `F' for the
intermediate images and timeseries.
</LI>
<LI>The use of the parameters for the source and background extraction areas 
requires some care. Although the source extraction region is simply a circle,
the under-sampled nature of the OM PSF means that the circle has a
small radius and thus encompasses only a few pixels. Pixels on the
circle edge therefore contribute a substantial fraction to the area,
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="$\pi r^2$"></SPAN> may not be a good approximation to the extraction
area. 

<P>
Furthermore, the background extraction region is an annulus,
possibly with circular areas excluded (see the <SMALL>OMREGION</SMALL> task
description), and these excluded circles are not necessarily totally
enclosed by the annulus. In addition, the FAST-mode OM window is small,
and a part of the source and background areas falls out of this window.
The source and background counts should be
scaled to the CAL circular area in order to correct them for the
coincidence loss. This scaling is sensitive to the currently used
OM PSF. If the source and background areas are affected by the 
source proximity to the edge of the OSW or if the real OM PSF differs
from that taken from the current calibration file (CCF), than the 
OMLCBUILD output count rates could vary from exposure to exposure,
even if the source brightness remains constant.

<P>
This effect could be increased for bright sources 
due to the 8-pixel pattern noise. In order to avoid these variations
and to obtain a uniform combined light curve, it is better to use 
a fixed radius for the source extraction area for all the exposures
in the ODF. This radius should not be less than 6 pixels, although for 
faint source one it is possible to use smaller values (this would 
increase the signal-to-noise ratio). The value of 6 pixels is currently used 
as the default value for the chain in order to get an optimal 
signal-to-noise ratio for most of the sources.
One may change this parameter by using  the command <I CLASS="sans">`omfchain srcradius=...`</I>.
If <I>srcradius</I> is set to a negative value, it will be regarded as measured 
in unbinned pixels and will be fixed for all the exposures 
(its default value is negative). 

<P>
When changing the <I>srcradius</I>
 parameter one should also properly establish
the background extraction area setting <I>bkginner</I> and <I>bkgouter</I>
parameters (see the description of the task parameters). 
</LI>
<LI>A few output files (P* files) from <I>omfchain</I> should be checked. A
useful first step is to inspect the output PDF-light curve plots to check that
the data are sensible - watch out for frequent drop-outs, isolated high or
substantial negative values. Establish that the background light curve is
reasonable (it would be constant for the option <I CLASS="sans">bkgfromimage=yes</I>). 
One should also examine the image of the Fast-mode window, for
example, with the ftool, <I>fv</I> or <I>ds9</I>. Check whether the source is well centred or
close to an edge. If the latter, inspect the light curves, especially from
different exposures, to see if the separate exposure-based light curves are
plausibly consistent (bearing in mind any intrinsic source variability). If the
image appears blurred or odd in any way, look at the tracking history file to
see whether tracking was reliable. You may also want to overlay the image
source list onto skymap using<I>implot</I>, e.g.

<P>
<B>implot set=</B>
sky_image_file.FIT <B>withsrclistset=y
srclistset=</B>osw_source_list_file.FIT <B>device=</B>your_device (e.g. <B>/XW</B>) <B>itv=1
radius=3 maxsrc=10 colour=7</B>.

<P>
While often there will be only one object in the image, one should check for
 spurious detections, which could affect the analysis of the target source and
 also for missed sources or prominent objects in the window, which may
 contaminate the target. Currently, bright contaminating sources are
 not treated properly, and, if present, affect the light curve of the target
 (and vice versa) - this will be rectified in a future version of the relevant
 SAS tasks. It is possible to change the detection efficiency via the <B> boxscale</B>, <B>smoothsize</B>, <B>nsigma</B>, and <B>contrast</B> parameters.

<P>
The visual inspection may also reveal that a bright source of interest is affected
by modulo-8 noise (a rectangular pattern around the source). Obviously, the 
standard (calibrated) point-spread function is not applicable to these kind
of images (the source counts could  be found at any pixel within the Fast-window;
and a large fraction of them fall outside of this window). For this kind of images
the determining of background from the Fast-window becomes impossible, and it would be
appropriate to consider the entire Fast-window as the source extraction region.
Since the sources generating modulo-8 noise patterns are quite bright,
the background becomes negligeable and, thus, could be set to zero. For this purpose
one can set the source extraction region to the entire Fast window by setting the 
parameter <I>srcradius</I> to, say, 12 pixels (half of the Fast-window x- or y-size).
The light-curve obtained in this way would be more reliable.
