ChangeLog for omfchain
===============================
Version 1.42.6 - 2014-09-30 (RDS) +(src/omfchain.pl): 
	- Uses taskmain for options handling (SPR-7237) 

Version 1.42.5 - 2014-09-09 (RDS) +(src/omfchain.pl): 
	- extra fix to bug (SPR-7206) which was precluding
	to calculate the background value from the imaging-mode data.
Version 1.42.4 - 2014-05-11 (VNY) +(test/testomfchain):
	explicitely set the parameter bkgfromimage to NO
	as the test data does not have NAXIS1 keyword in the 
	first extension 
Version 1.42.3 - 2014-05-08 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl): 
	- fixed a bug (SSC SPR report 7209) which was precluding
	to calculate the background value from the imaging-mode data.
Version 1.42.2 - 2014-04-02 (EC)
	- moved binary data test/*0099010101* to testprods/omfchain_data
Version 1.42.1 - 2013-02-27 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl, test/*)
	Removed an extra FAST-mode data set from the test folder (to reduce the
        test processing time); checked the size of the imaging-mode file
	(it will not be used if small).
Version 1.42 - 2012-07-19 (VNY) +(config/omfchain.par)
	Changed the default value of the parameter 
	bkgfromimage to "yes".
Version 1.41 - 2012-03-07 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl) 
	Fixed the problem with picking up the Raw attitude file
	(SSC-SPR-6692).
Version 1.40 - 2011-10-05 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl) 
	Corrected the wrong version dated 2011-10-04 (the changes
	were made to the downgraded version 1.38); the same changes
	to the version 1.39: 
	Improved the processing of bright source exposures: in 
	order to exclude casual jumps of the count rates when 
	the mod8factor for a given exposure exceeds the 0.35 threshold 
	the analysis of the mod8-factor is made only for the first 
	exposure of the series. The rest of the exposures are processed 
	with the same extraction radius as was decided for the first 
	exposure (no matter was it increased or left to be normal)	
Version 1.39 - 2011-06-07 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl, param/omfchain.par)
	A new parameter (rawattitude) is introduced to control the
	averaging of the raw attitude data.
Version 1.38 - 2010-04-21 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl, param/omfchain.par)
	A new optional parameter maxrawcountrate is introduced to
	establish the upper threshold for source PSF-photometry
	(required by omdetect).
Version 1.37.1 - 2010-03-26 (VNY): documentation updated.
Version 1.37 - 2010-01-31 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl, config/omfchain.par)
	The default value of the parameter bkgfromimage is set to NO;
	The wrong intermediate image file name is corrected;
	Protected against possible shortening of the postscript file
	name by pgplot in the task lcplot.
Version 1.36 - 2010-01-31 (VNY) +(DEPEND, config/omfchain.par)
	Updating the dependencies; changing the default value 
	of the parameter bkgfromimage to "yes".
Version 1.35 - 2010-01-26 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl, config/omfchain.par)
	New parameters are introduced to control the modified
	task omlcbuild. The parameter, "bkgfromimage=yes/no"
	allows using the background obtained from the accompanying
	imaging data. The parameter "psfphotometryenabled=yes/no"
	allows psf-photometry of the source in the task omdetect-5.22
Version 1.34.3 - 2008-05-20 (VNY) +(config/omfchain.par) The default value
	of the parameter nsigma is set to 3 instead of 2 in order
	to reduce the number of spurious sources detected in the 
	fast window (SSC-SPR-6462).
Version 1.34.2 - 2007-06-07 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl) Fixing a bug
	of the previous version: by accident a few task were excluded
	from processing (restoring them). 
Version 1.34.1 - 2007-06-07 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl) Increasing the 
	source extraction radius for very bright sources, which are
	badly affected by coincidence losses and modulo-9 noise 
	in order to avoid negative background counts, which is happen
	when applying the standard background calculation procedure 
	designed for the normal sources. Effectively, in these cases
	the background extraction region is forced to zero size 
	(fixing SSC-SPR-3144).	
Version 1.34 - 2006-05-23 (VNY) A protection against generating an empty 
	PDF-file is introduced (SSC-SPR-3604) for the rare cases when 
	the omlcbuild task for some reason could not produce the light-curve
	PS-plot
Version 1.33.1 - 2006-05-18 (VNY) Checking for the consistency of
	the sampling and binning intervals is introduced
	(SSC-SPR-3598)
Version 1.33 - 2005-11-10 (VNY) Adjusted to the changes in the 
	source region file made by omdetect (SSC-SPR-3538)

	filter exposure is found in the ODF (SSC-SPR-3480)
Version 1.31.7 - 2005-05-23 (CB1) Ammended DEPEND file to fix build problem.
Version 1.31.6 - 2004-05-28 (VNY) +(src/omfchain.pl) The subroutine
	GetCurrentDirectory is modified in order to protect 
        it from a failure during the test in Mac-machines 
Version 1.31.5 - 2004-05-27 (VNY) +(test/testomfchain) picking un
	the SAS_ODF variable is modified in order to avoid test 
	failure on Mac-machines
Version 1.31.4 - 2004-02-24 (VNY) The statement use DAL removed,
	since it is not necessary anymore.
Version 1.31.3 - 2004-02-11 (VNY) The parameter --odf has been 
	remover from the calls to all of the tasks
	(SSC-SPR-3254)
Version 1.31.2 - 2004-02-11 (VNY) the parameter --odf was removed
	from the calls to omprep. This could cause crashes in 
	some computers (SPR-3254)
Version 1.31.1 - 2004-02-01 (VNY) The problem described in 
	SSC-SPR-3238 is fixed. In the case of the output directoy
	chosen to be different from that containing the input ODF
	there was a possibility of missin a flat-field file (FFX)
	created to satisfy omfastflat task. At the same time the 
	task is protected against crashing when the verbosity
	level is higher than seven.
Version 1.31 - 2003-11-21 (VNY) DEPEND file updated to match 
	the new version (3.0) of ssclib
Version 1.30 - 2003-09-29 (VNY) A part of the code was restored that 
	creates a unit flat field file (FFX) in the case of not 
	finding a real FFX in the curret ODF: this was removed temporarily
	for test purposes and not restored by a mistake (SSC-SPR-3151)
Version 1.29 - 2003-06-16 (VNY) the task is cleaned from the PERL-5 error 
	messages, when the latter is working in its strict mode

	OMDETECT-4.1 instead of V3.6
Version 1.26 - 2002-09-27 (VNY) DEPEND file updated (now dsslib is 4.0).
        First call to OMPREP is modified in accordance to the updated
	modeset parameter (modeset=3 for tracking). 

Version 1.25 - 2002-06-11 (VNY)  +(src/omfchain.pl) Formation of the list
	of the input ODF-files is changes in order to cope
	with the local codification table at Jupiter machine (SPR-2876)
	
Version 1.24 - 2002-06-10 (VNY)	
	+ (src/omfchain.pl) Modified to make it look into the correct
	directory for the SAS summary file when SAS_ODF has been set
	to point to the file (fixes SPR 2899). A bug with redirection
	of the FFX-file has been fixed (SPR-2900).
	+(config/omfchain.info): GROUPS parameter  has been set
	to 'om' instead of 'pipeline'.
	
Version 1.23 - 2002-05-22 (VNY) DEPEND and +config/onfchain.par files
	have been updated in order to work with new PARAM-2.0

	 missed orbit file in the test directory has been restored
	(SSC-SPR-2817); 
	smooth size parameter is set to 12 (its default value was 64
	that exceeds the Fast Mode window size).

	+(src/omfchain.pl, config/omfchain.par)  additional input
	parameters have been introduced in order to make possible
	online changes of the source extraction radius, as well
	as some parameters for online improvement of the source
	detectability by omdetect. Dependencies are updated.

Version 1.20.1 - 2001-11-19
	+(src/omfchain.pl) The names have been changed for the Tracking

              routine call (default values were 1 and 2, now they are 1.2 and 1.8) in order
              to avoid contamination of the background with the source counts;
               - dummy flat field file created (FFX) in case it
