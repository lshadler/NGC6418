ChangeLog for lccorr_pcms
===============================


Open SPRs:
----------
3403, 3406, 3557, 3585, 3648

Version 1.6.1 - 2009-05-12 (EO)
-------------
	+ Re-fixed DEPEND.

Version 1.6 - 2009-05-11 (EO)
-----------
	+ Fixed DEPEND file.

Version 1.5.1 - 2007-04-12 (MAS/LUX)
----------------------
- Changed exposure_map_pcms.f90 so as to fix SPR 3659 (wrong calculation of BKGRATIO, given as the header keyword in the output FITS).  Note that this bug only appears in this lccorr_pcms package (NOT in the lccorr package).
- Set testFlag in one of the subroutines in exposure_map_pcms.f90 to be false, which was unintentionally true.
- Upgraded routines related writeCubeData() in eexpchipmap_pcms_mod.f90.
- In lccorr_pcms, added the comment for the BKGRATIO header keyword.
	
Version 1.5 - 2006-04-12 (MAS/LUX)
----------------------
- Changed exposure_map*.f90 so as to fix SPR 3596 (MOS pheripheral chips NOT processed when the central chip is in the timing mode).
- Note: Now, instead of relying on CAL_getState() for getting the informaion of the CCDMODE, now it is got directly from the FITS header of the input file.
- Note: This change has been made so far only in lccorr_pcms (not lccorr).

Version 1.4.1 - 2006-04-10 (MAS/LUX)
----------------------
- Changed lc*_mod.f90 so as to fix SPR 3595 ('noSrcArea': error -> normal exit with warning)

Version 1.4 - 2006-02-22 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Changed exposure_aux.f90 in line with lccorr-2.27.
- Dependency on ssclib increased to 3.29.

Version 1.3 - 2005-12-01 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Improved some error messages.
- Added 2 lines of message output.
- Fixed a bug: fine-scale pseudo-event filtering had been left commented out, so that areas of extraction regions were too small.
- Fixed another bug: the hexadecimal parameter --flagmask was not being transmitted to the exposure-correction machinery.

Version 1.2 - 2005-11-17 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Parameter --withboresightfudge (default 'yes') added to lccorr_pcms and eexpchipmap_pcms (until sign of boresight psi is corrected).
- DEPENDency on attcalc2, eimchip2sky and ssclib all brought up to date (1.2, 2.0 and 3.27 respectively).
- Made other changes to eexpchipmap_pcms so it conforms with latest attcalc2 and eimchip2sky.

Version 1.1 - 2005-11-07 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Added a test harness.

Version 1.0 - 2005-11-02 (IMS/LUX)
----------------------
- Contains versions of eexpchipmap and lccorr (but no other lccorr tasks) which have been kludged in an attempt to circumvent F95 compiler problems. This package was modified from lccorr-2.21.
- Added new parameter --srcdeducestyle and rearranged the parameter tree structure (to help support --srcweightstyle='events').
- Fixed a bug in exposure_map_pcms in which the task was failing if any CCD had no overlap from the src or bkg extraction region.
- --srcweightstyle='events' is now supported.
- Added new parameter --tempeventset to both lccorr_pcms and eexpchipmap_pcms.
- Added two new parameters --srcregiontab and --bkgregiontab, plus necessary changes to lccorr_include.f90, lccorr_pcms_mod.f90, lccorr_corrector.f90 and exposure_map_pcms.f90 to make use of them. This is necessary to convey region filtering data to the exposure calculator.
- Changed DEPEND of attcalc2 to 1.0 to overcome linux build problem.
- DISTRIBUTION changed from world to ssc.
