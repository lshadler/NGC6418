CTI correction</A>
</H2>

<P>
In CCDs part of the charge released by an absorbed photon is lost during
transfer to the readout node. This loss depends on several parameters, in
particular on the position where the photon was detected, its energy, the
temperature of the CCD, and the saturation of traps by charges preceding along
the readout direction. In order to determine how these parameters affect the
charge loss of the pn-CCD cameras, more than three billion events were
recorded in extensive sets of calibration measurements from February 1998 to
January 1999.

<P>
For deriving the CTI, each CCD column was split into macro pixels, which were
determined by adaptive binning to contain a sufficient number of first singles
around the line feature. The charge losses were then obtained, column by
column, by cross-correlating a spectral template accumulated from all first
singles of a column with spectra from the macro pixels of the same column, to
yield a first estimate of the energy shifts. This value was then used to
improve the template and the cross-correlation was repeated until convergence
was achieved.

<P>
In order to obtain a general CTI correction code, a model based on the capture
and emission process of electrons in deep level traps was developed. This
model, described in detail in 
[], 
considers the dependence of the
CTI on energy and temperature, and takes the effect of precursors and the
presence of noisy pixels into account. It was calibrated with the spatially
resolved charge losses obtained with the technique described above, and makes
it possible to calibrate not only the spectral response of each pixel, but
also the mutual influence of pixels along the same CCD readout column.

<P>
