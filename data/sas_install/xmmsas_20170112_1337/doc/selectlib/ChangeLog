Change log for selectlib
========================

Open SOC-SPRs/SCRs:
    *none*

Version 4.74.1 - 2016-11-30 (AI)
--------------
	+ (src/selcore/NumericFunctors.cc) Removed an isnan extern macro that was giving an 
	error in MAC OSX (gcc 6.2) compilation. 
	
Version 4.74 - 2016-30-08 (AI)
--------------
	+ (src/selcore/Evaluator.cc) Conditional expression in input attibute of 
	lexinit method call removed (gcc-6.1 throws a run time error) and 
	now the contional expression is evaluated outside the method call.
	
Version 4.73 - 2015-13-03 (AI)
--------------
	+ src/selcore/VectorFunctors.cc: The inner product of the median spacecraft attitude and the 
	current spacecraft attitude vectors can end up with a value greater than 1.0 (error propagation).
	If this is the case, the ConeFilterLogic is wrong and the attitude is discared from the GTI returned by attfilter.
	The result of the inner product is checked and if it is greater than one, the value is reseted to 1.0.
	
Version 4.72.1 - 2014-09-04 (EO)

	  build the release track.

------------
    + fixed non-working example of table filtering expression in documentation
