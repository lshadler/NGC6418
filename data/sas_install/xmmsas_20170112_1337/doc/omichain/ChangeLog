ChangeLog for omichain
===============================

Version 1.71.1 - 2014-09-30 (RDS) 
--------------	
	+(src/omichain.pl) Uses taskmain to handle command line options

Version 1.71 - 2014-04-02 (EC)

	- removed other unused binary data 

Version 1.70 - 2014-03-20 (VNY,EOP) 
--------------	
	+(src/omichain.pl) Changed the name of the intermediate 
	image (detectorCoordImageFileName) which was marked as 
	a product (P...), but which was actually not the final 
	product (i.e. it should be I...) in the call to the routine 
	omqualitymap. The terminating string of this name is changed 
	from _windowNo0 to 3windowNo0. The name of the image containing 
	the quality map (stringQmap2) is changed from QIMA2_windowNo 
	to IMAGE_windowNo.	
Version 1.69.1 - 2013-08-02 (VNY)
------------

Version 1.67 - 2012-12-04 (VNY)	
------------	
	+(src/omichain.pl) Protected from crashing when finding
	an undefined OM filter.
Version 1.66 - 2012-12-02 (VNY)	
------------	
	+(src/omichain.pl) added the task omregion to generate
	the region file for the merged source list
Version 1.65 - 2012-11-23 (VNY)
------------
	+(src/omichain.pl) Introduced the creation of the region file
	for the mosaiced sky image; the extensions of region files
	are changed from .ASC to .reg to make them consistent with ds9;
	Introduced the task omvariability to calculate the 
	exposure-to-exposure source variability parameters
	+(config/omichain.par); the default value of the parameter 
	"processmosaicedimages" is set to "yes" (was "no").
Version 1.64 - 2012-11-19 (VNY)
------------
	+(src/omichain.pl) Protected against possible crash of omprep
	if the input ODF does not contain the correct raw attitude data. 
Version 1.63 - 2012-11-14 (VNY)
	+(DEPEND) Dependencies updated
------------

Version 1.61 - 2011-06-07 (VNY) 
------------
	+(src/omichain.pl) Setting the default value of the parameter 
	rawattitude to 1, which means using the Raw Attitude File and 
	averaging attitude for the first 20 s of the exposure; 
	in the case the tracking history file is not found or the images 
	are in the full-frame mode (ENG2 or ENG4) then the value of 
	the parameter rawattitude is reset to 2, which means averaging 
	raw attitudes over the whole exposure time
Version 1.60 - 2011-05-20 (VNY)
------------	
	+(src/omichain.pl) The algorithm for compiling the image file lists
	corresponding to the same OM filter is modified to use the
	unique filter number to prevent stacking images from different
	filters (SSC-SPR-6655).
Version 1.59 - 2011-03-22 (VNY)
-------------
	+(config/omichain.par, src/omichain.pl) introduced the optional
	parameter rawattitude, which is required by the new version
	of omprep.
